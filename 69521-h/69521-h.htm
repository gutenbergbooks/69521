<p class="ph2">SURPRISE HOUSE</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>THE HOUSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the main street of Crowfield stood a little
old red house, with a gabled roof, a pillared
porch, and a quaint garden. For many weeks it
had been quite empty, the shutters closed and
the doors locked; ever since the death of Miss
Nan Corliss, the old lady who had lived there for
years and years.</p>

<p>It began to have the lonesome look which a
house has when the heart has gone out of it and
nobody puts a new heart in. The garden was
growing sad and careless. The flowers drooped
and pouted, and leaned peevishly against one
another. Only the weeds seemed glad,—as
undisturbed weeds do,—and made the most
of their holiday to grow tall and impertinent
and to crowd their more sensitive neighbors
out of their very beds.</p>

<p>But one September day something happened
to the old house. A lady and gentleman, a big
girl and a little boy, came walking over the slate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
stones between the rows of sulky flowers. The
gentleman, who was tall and thin and pale,
opened the front door with a key bearing a huge
tag, and cried:—</p>

<p>“Good-day, Crowfield! Welcome your new
friends to their new home. We greet you kindly,
old house. Be good to us!”</p>

<p>“What a dear house!” said the lady, as they
entered the front hall. “I know I am going to
like it. This paneled woodwork is beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Open the windows, John, so that we can see
what we are about,” said Dr. Corliss.</p>

<p>John shoved up the dusty windows and pushed
out the queer little wooden shutters, and a flood
of September sunshine poured into the old house,
chasing away the shadows. It was just as if the
house took a long breath and woke up from its
nap.</p>

<p>“What a funny place to live in!” cried Mary.
“It’s like a museum.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled John. “I bet we’ll have
fun here.”</p>

<p>The hallway in which they stood did, indeed,
seem rather like the entrance to a museum, as
Mary Corliss said. On the white paneled walls
which Mrs. Corliss admired were hanging all
sorts of queer things: huge shells, and ships in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
glass cases, stuffed fishes, weapons, and china-ware.
On a shelf between the windows stood a
row of china cats, blue, red, green, and yellow,
grinning mischievously at the family who confronted
them. On the floor were rugs of bright
colors, and odd chairs and tables sprawled about
like quadrupeds ready to run.</p>

<p>“Gee!” whispered John Corliss, “don’t they
look as if they were just ready to bark and mew
and wow at us? Do you suppose it’s welcome
or unwelcome, Daddy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, welcome, of course!” said Dr. Corliss.
“I dare say they remember me, at least, though
it’s thirty years since I was in this house. Thirty
years! Just think of it!”</p>

<p>They were in the parlor now, which had been
Miss Corliss’s “best room.” And this was even
queerer than the hallway had been. It was
crowded with all sorts of collections in cabinets,
trophies on the walls, pictures, and ornaments.</p>

<p>Dr. Corliss looked around with a chuckle.
“Hello!” he cried. “Here are a lot of the old
relics I remember so well seeing when I was a
boy, visiting Aunt Nan in the summer-time.
Yes, there’s the old matchlock over the door;
and here’s the fire-bucket, and the picture of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
George Washington’s family. I expect Aunt Nan
didn’t change anything here in all the thirty
years since she let any of her relatives come to
see her. Yes, there’s the wax fruit in the glass
jar—just as toothsome as ever! There’s the
shell picture she made when she was a girl.
My! How well I remember everything!”</p>

<p>They moved from room to room of the old
house, flinging open the blinds and letting fresh
air and sunshine in upon the strange furniture
and decorations. Mrs. Corliss looked about
with increasing bewilderment. How was she
ever to make this strange place look like their
home? Aunt Nan and her queer ways seemed
stamped upon everything.</p>

<p>“It’s a funny collection of things, Owen!” she
laughed to her husband. “All this furniture is
mine, I suppose, according to Aunt Nan’s will.
But I am glad we have some things of our own
to bring and make it seem more like a truly
home. Otherwise I should feel, as Mary says,
as if we were living in a kind of museum.”</p>

<p>“We can change it as much as we like, by and
by,” her husband reassured her.</p>

<p>“What a funny old lady Great-Aunt Nan
must have been, Daddy!” said John, who had
been examining a hooked rug representing a blue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
cat chasing a green mouse. “Did she make this,
do you think?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Dr. Corliss. “I remember
seeing her working at it. She hooked all these
rugs. It was one of her favorite amusements.
She was strange enough, I believe. I can remember
some of the weird things she used to do
when I was a lad. She used to put on a man’s
coat and hat and shovel coal or snow like any
laborer. She was always playing tricks on somebody,
or making up a game about what she
happened to be doing. We must expect surprises
and mysteries about the house as we
come to live here. It wouldn’t be Aunt Nan’s
house without them.—Hello!”</p>

<p>John had sat down on a little three-legged
stool in the corner; and suddenly he went <i>bump!</i>
on the floor. The legs of the stool had spread as
if of their own accord and let him down.</p>

<p>“That was one of Aunt Nan’s jokes, I remember!”
laughed Dr. Corliss. “Oh, yes! I
got caught myself once in the same way when
I was a boy.”</p>

<p>“Tell about it, Father,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Well; I was about your age, John,—about
ten; and I was terribly bashful. One day when
I was visiting Aunt Nan the minister came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
call. And though I tried to escape out of the
back door, Aunt Nan spied me and made me
come in to shake hands. As soon as I could I
sidled away into a corner, hoping he would forget
about me.</p>

<p>“This innocent little stool stood there by the
stuffed bird cabinet, just as it does now, and I
sat down on it very quietly. Then <i>bump!</i> I went
on to the floor, just as John did. Only I was not
so lucky. I lost my balance and kicked my heels
up almost in the minister’s face. I can tell you
I was mortified! And Aunt Nan laughed. But
the minister was very nice about it, I will say.
I remember he only smiled kindly and said, ‘A
little weak in the legs,—eh, John? I’m glad
my stool in church isn’t like that, Miss Corliss.
I’d never trust you to provide me with furniture,—eh,
what?’”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that was a bit funny joke,”
spluttered John, who had got to his feet looking
very red.</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” said his mother. “I hate
practical jokes. I hope we shan’t meet any more
of this sort.”</p>

<p>“You never can tell!” Dr. Corliss chuckled
reminiscently.</p>

<p>“What a horrid mirror!” exclaimed Mary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
peering into the glass of a fine gilt frame. “See!
It makes me look as broad as I am long, and ugly
as a hippopotamus. The idea of putting this in
the parlor!”</p>

<p>“Probably she meant that to keep her guests
from growing conceited,” suggested Dr. Corliss
with a grin. “But we shall not need to have it
here if we don’t like it. There’s plenty of room
in the attic, if I remember rightly.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we shall have to change a great many
things,” said Mrs. Corliss, who had been moving
about the room all by herself. “What do you suppose
is in that pretty carved box on the mantel?”</p>

<p>“It’s yours, Mother. Why don’t you open it?”
said John eagerly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Corliss lifted the cover and started back
with a scream. For out sprang what looked like
a real snake, straight into her face.</p>

<p>“Oh! Is it alive?” cried Mary, shuddering.</p>

<p>But John had picked up the Japanese paper
snake and was dangling it merrily to reassure
his mother. “I’ve seen those before,” he grinned.
“The boys had them at school once.”</p>

<p>“Come, come!” frowned Dr. Corliss. “That
was really too bad of Aunt Nan. She knew that
almost everybody hates snakes, though she
didn’t mind them herself. I’ve often seen her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
put a live one in her pocket and bring it home to
look at.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” shuddered Mrs. Corliss. “I hope
they don’t linger about anywhere. I see I shall
have to clean the whole house thoroughly from
top to bottom. And if I find any more of these
jokes—!” Mrs. Corliss nodded her head vigorously,
implying bad luck to any snakes that
might be playing hide-and-seek in house or
garden.</p>

<p>Secretly John thought all this was great
fun, and he dashed ahead of the rest of the
family on their tour of the house, hoping to find
still other proofs of Aunt Nan’s special kind of
humor. But to the relief of Mary and her
mother the rest of their first exploring expedition
was uneventful.</p>

<p>They visited dining-room and kitchen and pantry,
and the room that was to be Dr. Corliss’s
study. Then they climbed the stairs to the bedroom
floor, where there were three pretty little
chambers. They took a peep into the attic; but
even there, in the crowded shadows and cobwebs,
nothing mysterious happened. It was a nice old
house where the family felt that they were going
to be very happy and contented.</p>

<p>Down the stairs they came once more, to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
door of the ell which they had not yet visited.
It was a brown wooden door with a glass knob.</p>

<p>“Well, here is your domain, Mary!” said Dr.
Corliss, pausing and pointing to the door with a
smile. “This is your library, my daughter. Have
you the key ready?”</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, Mary had the key ready; a great
key tagged carefully,—as all the other keys of
Aunt Nan’s property had been,—this one bearing
the legend: “LIBRARY. Property of Mary
Corliss.”</p>

<p>“Here is the key, Father,” said Mary, stepping
up proudly. “Let me put it in myself. Oh,
I hope there are no horrid jokes in here!”
And she hesitated a moment before fitting the
key in the lock of her library—her very own
library!</p>

<small>THE LIBRARY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ACCORDING to the will left by that eccentric
old lady, Miss Nan Corliss, her nephew,
Dr. Corliss,—whom she had not seen for thirty
years,—was to receive the old house at Crowfield.
His wife inherited all the furniture of the
old house, except what was in the library. John
Corliss, the only grandnephew, was to have two
thousand dollars to send him to college when he
should be old enough to go. And to Mary, the
unknown grandniece whom she had never seen,
Aunt Nan had declared should belong “my library
room at Crowfield, with everything therein
remaining.”</p>

<p>Mary was now going to see what her library
was like, and what therein remained. She drew
a long breath, turned the key, pushed open the
door, and peered cautiously into the room, half
expecting something to jump out at her. But
nothing of the sort happened. John pushed her
in impatiently, and they all followed, eager, as
John said, to see “what sister had drawn.” Dr.
Corliss himself had never been inside this room,
Aunt Nan’s most sacred corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>What they saw was a plain, square room, with
shelves from floor to ceiling packed tightly with
rows of solemn-looking books. In one corner
stood a tall clock, over the top of which perched
a stuffed crow, black and stern. In the center
of the room was a table-desk, with papers scattered
about, just as Aunt Nan had left it weeks
before. On the mantel above the fireplace was
a bust of Shakespeare and some smaller ornaments,
with an old tin lantern. Above the
Shakespeare hung a portrait of a lady with gray
curls, in an old-fashioned dress, holding a book
in her hand. The other hand was laid upon her
breast with the forefinger extended as if pointing.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said Dr. Corliss when he spied the
portrait, “this is Aunt Nan herself as she looked
when I last saw her; and a very good likeness
it is.”</p>

<p>“She looks like a witch!” said John. “See
what funny eyes she has!”</p>

<p>“Sh! John! You mustn’t talk like that about
your great-aunt,” corrected his mother. “She
has been very good to us all. You must at least
be respectful.”</p>

<p>“She was eccentric, certainly,” said Dr. Corliss.
“But she meant to be kind, I am sure. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
never knew why she refused to see any of her
family, all of a sudden—some whim, I suppose.
She came to be a sort of hermitess after a while.
She loved her books more than anything in the
world. It meant a great deal that she wanted
you to have them, Mary.”</p>

<p>“I wish she had left <i>me</i> two thousand dollars!”
said Mary, pouting. “These old books
don’t look very interesting. I want to go to college
more than John does. But I don’t suppose
I ever can, now.”</p>

<p>“Books are rather useful, whether one goes to
college or not,” her father reminded her. “She
needn’t have left you anything, Mary. She
never even saw you—or John either, for that
matter. She hadn’t seen me since I was married.
I take it very kindly of her to have remembered
us so generously. I thought her pet hospital
would receive everything.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose became of her jewelry,
Owen?” asked Mrs. Corliss in an undertone.
“I thought she might leave that to Mary,
the only girl in the family. But there was no
mention of it in her will.”</p>

<p>“She must have sold it for the benefit of her
hospital. She was very generous to that charity,”
said Dr. Corliss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>Mary and John had been poking about the library
to see if they could find anything “queer.”
But it all seemed disappointingly matter-of-fact.
They stopped in front of the tall clock which
had not been wound up for weeks.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to start the clock, Father,” said
Mary. “The old crow looks as if he expected us
to.”</p>

<p>“The key is probably inside the clock case,”
said Dr. Corliss, opening the door.</p>

<p>Sure enough, there was the key hanging on a
peg. And tied to it was the usual tag. But instead
of saying “Clock Key,” as one would have
expected, this tag bore these mysterious words
in the handwriting which Mary knew was Aunt
Nan’s: “<i>Look under the raven’s wing.</i>”</p>

<p>“Now, what in the world does that mean?”
asked Mary, staring about the room. “What
did she mean by ‘the raven,’ do you suppose?”</p>

<p>“I guess she means the old crow up there,”
cried John, pointing at the stuffed bird over the
clock.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose she meant that, Father?”
asked Mary again, looking rather ruefully at the
ominous crow.</p>

<p>“Maybe she meant that,” said her father,
sitting down in a library chair to await what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
would happen. “But I believe this is another
of Aunt Nan’s little jokes. It sounds so to me.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! It’s just an old April Fool, I bet!”
jeered John.</p>

<p>Mary still stared at what Aunt Nan called
“the raven,” and wondered. “Under which
wing am I to look?” she thought. Finally she
gathered courage to reach up her hand toward
the right wing, very cautiously. She half expected
that the creature might come alive and
nip her. But nothing happened. There was
nothing under the right wing but moth-eaten
feathers, some of which came off in Mary’s fingers.</p>

<p>“I’ll try the other wing,” said Mary to herself.
She poked her fingers under the old bird’s
left wing. Yes! There was something there.
Something dangled by a hidden string from the
wing-bone of Aunt Nan’s raven. Mary pulled,
and presently something came away. In her
hand she held a little gold watch and chain.
On the case was engraved the letter <i>C</i>, which
was of course as truly Mary’s initial as it had
been Aunt Nan Corliss’s.</p>

<p>“Why, it is Aunt Nan’s watch, sure enough!”
said Dr. Corliss, beaming. “Well, Mary! I declare,
that is something worth while. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
needed a watch, my dear. But I don’t know
when I could ever have bought a gold one for
you. This is a beauty.”</p>

<p>“It’s a bird of a watch!” piped John, wagging
his head at the crow.</p>

<p>“I like it better than wriggly snakes,” said
Mrs. Corliss, smiling.</p>

<p>“Oh, how good Aunt Nan was to leave it here
for me!” said Mary. “I am beginning to like
Aunt Nan, in spite of her queerness.”</p>

<p>“I like this kind of joke she plays on you,”
said John enviously. “I wish she’d play one
like that on me, too. I say, Mary, do you suppose
there are any more secrets hidden in your
old library? Let’s look now.”</p>

<p>“I wonder!” said Mary, looking curiously
about the dingy room. “But I don’t want to
look any further now. I am satisfied. Oh, Mumsie!
Just look!” Mary put the chain of the new
watch around her neck, tucked the little chronometer
into her belt, and trotted away to see
the effect in the crooked old mirror of the parlor.</p>

<p>John wanted to take down the crow and examine
him further.</p>

<p>“Come along, John,” said his father, pushing
the little brother toward the door. “This is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Mary’s room, you know. We aren’t ever to
poke around here without her leave, mind
you.”</p>

<p>“No,” said John reluctantly. “But I do
wish—!” And he cast a longing glance back
over his shoulder as his father shut the door on
Mary’s mysterious library.</p>

<small>A VISITOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE very next day Dr. Corliss shut himself
up in his new study while Mrs. Corliss and
Mary set to work to make the old house as fresh
as new. They brushed up the dust and cobwebs
and scrubbed and polished everything until it
shone. They dragged many ugly old things off
into the attic, and pushed others back into the
corners until there should be time to decide what
had best be done with them. Meanwhile, John
was helping to tidy up the little garden, snipping
off dead leaves, cheering up the flowers,
and punishing the greedy weeds.</p>

<p>The whistles of Crowfield factories shrieked
noon before they all stopped to take breath.
Then Mrs. Corliss gasped and said:—</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary! I forgot all about luncheon!
What are we going to feed your poor father with,
I wonder, to say nothing of our hungry selves?”</p>

<p>Just at this moment John came running into
the house with a very dirty face. “There’s some
one coming down the street,” he called upstairs;
“I think she’s coming in here.” He peeped out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
of the parlor window discreetly. “Yes, she’s
opening the gate now.”</p>

<p>“Let Mary open the door when she rings,”
warned his mother. “It will be the first time
our doorbell rings for a visitor—quite an event,
Mary! I am sure John’s face is dirty.”</p>

<p>“I’m not very tidy myself,” said Mary, taking
off her apron and the dusting-cap which covered
her curls, and rolling down her sleeves.</p>

<p>The latch of the little garden gate clicked while
they were speaking, and looking out of the upstairs
hall window Mary saw a girl of about her
own age, thirteen or fourteen, coming up the
path. She wore a pretty blue sailor suit and a
broad hat, and her hair hung in two long flaxen
braids down her back. Mary wore her own brown
curls tied back with a ribbon. On her arm the
visitor carried a large covered basket.</p>

<p>“It’s one of the neighbors, I suppose,” said
Mrs. Corliss, attempting a hasty toilet. “Go to
the door, Mary, as soon as she rings, and ask her
to come in. Even if we are not settled yet, it is
not too soon to be hospitable.”</p>

<p>Mary listened eagerly for the bell. Their first
caller in Crowfield looked like a very nice little
person. Perhaps she was going to be Mary’s
friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>But the bell did not ring. Instead, Mary presently
heard a little click; and then a voice in
the hall below called, apparently through the
keyhole of the closed door,—“Not at home.”</p>

<p>There was a pause, and again,—“Not at
home.” A third time the tired, monotonous
voice declared untruthfully, “Not at home.”
Then there was silence.</p>

<p>“John!” cried Mary, horrified. For she
thought her brother was playing some naughty
trick. What did he mean by such treatment of
their first caller? Mary ran down the stairs two
steps at a time, and there she found John in the
hall, staring with wide eyes at the front door.</p>

<p>“What made you—?” began Mary.</p>

<p>“I didn’t!” protested John. “It was—Something,
I don’t know What, that spoke.
When she pushed the bell-button it didn’t ring,
but it made <i>that</i>. And now I guess she’s gone off
mad!”</p>

<p>“Oh, John!” Mary threw open the door and
ran to the porch. Sure enough, the visitor was
retreating slowly down the path. She turned,
however, when she heard Mary open the door,
and hesitated, looking rather reproachful. She
was very pretty, with red cheeks and bright
brown eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“Oh! I’m so sorry!” said Mary. “You didn’t
ring, did you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” said the girl, looking puzzled.
“But I thought no one was at home. Somebody
said so.” Her eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>Mary liked the twinkle in her eyes.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand it!” said Mary, wrinkling
her forehead in puzzlement. Then an idea
flashed into her head, and she showed her teeth
in a broad smile. “Oh, it must have been one
of Aunt Nan’s patent jokes.”</p>

<p>The girl gave an answering smile. “You
mean Miss Corliss?” she suggested. “I know
she didn’t like callers. We never ventured to
ring the bell in her day. But Mother thought
you new neighbors might be different. And I
saw you going by yesterday, so I thought I’d
try—” She looked at Mary wistfully, with a
little cock to her head. “My name is Katy Summers,
and we are your nearest neighbors,” she
added.</p>

<p>“Oh, do come in,” urged Mary, holding open
the door hospitably. “It is so nice to see you! I
am Mary Corliss.”</p>

<p>Katy Summers beamed at her as she crossed
the doorsill. And from that moment Mary hoped
that they were going to be the best of friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>John appeared just then, much excited and
forgetting his dirty face. “It must be a kind of
graphophone,” he said, without introduction.
“Let me punch that button.”</p>

<p>Twisting himself out into the porch, John
pushed a dirty thumb against the bell-button
of the Corliss home. Instantly sounded the
same monotonous response,—“Not at home— Not
at home— Not at home.”</p>

<p>“I say! Isn’t it great!” shouted John, cutting
a caper delightedly. “Aunt Nan must have had
that fixed so as to scare away callers. Wasn’t
she cute?”</p>

<p>Mary blushed for her brother, and for the
reputation of the house. “It wasn’t cute!” she
said hastily. “We shall have to get that bell
changed. We aren’t like that, really,” she explained
to her visitor. “We love to see people.
You were very good to come to this inhospitable
old house.”</p>

<p>“I wanted to,” said Katy simply, “and
Mother thought you’d perhaps all be busy this
morning, getting settled. So she sent you over
this hot luncheon.” And she held out to Mary
the heavy basket.</p>

<p>“Oh, how kind of you!” cried Mary. “Let
me tell Mother. She will be so pleased! It is so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
nice to have our nearest neighbor call on us
right away.”</p>

<p>“I can’t stop but a minute this time,” said
Katy, “for my own luncheon is waiting on the
table. But I’d like to see your mother. I’ll
wait here in the hall.”</p>

<p>At the end of the hall facing the front door
was an armchair with a back studded with brass
nails. Katy sat down in this chair to wait for
Mrs. Corliss. Mary ran up the stairs feeling
very happy, because already she had found this
new friend in the town where she was afraid she
was going to be lonesome.</p>

<p>But hardly had she reached the top of the
stairs when she heard a funny little cry from
the hall below. It was Katy’s voice that called.
“Oh!” it cried. “Help! Mary Corliss!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” called Mary, leaning over the
banisters to see what the matter was.</p>

<p>And then she saw a queer thing. The chair
in which Katy Summers sat was moving rapidly
of its own accord straight toward the front door.
Katy was too startled to move, and there she sat,
grasping the arms of the chair, until it reached
the doorsill. When it touched the sill, the chair
stopped and gently tilted itself forward, making
Katy slide out, whether she would or no.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“Well, I never!” said Katy with a gasp.
“If that isn’t the impolitest chair I ever
saw!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Katy!” cried Mary, flying down the
stairs. “I am so sorry. We didn’t know it was
that kind of chair. We hadn’t cleaned the hall
yet, so we never suspected. It must be another
of Aunt Nan’s jokes. She probably had this
made so that peddlers or agents who got inside
and insisted on waiting to see her would be discouraged.
Please don’t blame us!”</p>

<p>Then down came Mrs. Corliss, with Katy’s
basket in her hand. “What a reception to our
first caller!” she said with a rueful smile. “And
you came on such a kind errand, too! But you
must try to forget, little neighbor, that this was
ever an inhospitable house, and come to see us
often. We are going to change many things.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, I shall come again,” said Katy
Summers. “I hope that Mary and I shall be in
the same class at High School.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Mary. “I begin to-morrow.
Will you call for me so that I can have some one
to introduce me on my first day?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Katy, with a roguish look, “if
you’ll let me wait for you in the garden.”</p>

<p>Mary turned red. “You needn’t be afraid,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
she said. “We won’t let those things happen
any more, will we, Mother?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Corliss. “We will have the
carpenter attend to those ‘jokes’ at once.”</p>

<p>But until the carpenter came John had a beautiful
time riding down the front hall on the inhospitable
chair, and making the automatic
butler cry, “Not at home.” John thought it a
great pity to change these ingenious devices
which made the front hall of Aunt Nan’s house
so interesting. But he was in the minority, and
that very afternoon the carpenter took away an
electric device from the old armchair, which
ended its days of wandering forever. And instead
of the “bell” he put an old-fashioned
knocker on the front door.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>THE BOOKS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE town of Crowfield was built on a swift-flowing
river with a waterfall, which gave
it strong water-power. So the houses were easily
fitted with electricity. Even the old Corliss
mansion was up to date in that respect, at least.
This was why Aunt Nan had been able to carry
out her liking for queer devices and unexpected
mechanical effects, as Mr. Griggs, the carpenter,
explained when he came to make more hospitable
the front hall. He chuckled over the
moving chair, the secret of which was a spring
concealed under one of the brass nail-heads.
Any one who sat down and leaned back was sure
to press this button, whereupon the chair would
begin to move.</p>

<p>“It beats all how clever that old lady was!”
said Mr. Griggs. “I never saw anything like
this before. She must ’a’ got some electrician
down from the city to fix this up for her. We
don’t do that kind of job in Crowfield.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose there are any more such
things about the house?” inquired Mrs. Corliss
anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“I’ll take a look,” said Mr. Griggs. “But I
mightn’t find ’em, even so.”</p>

<p>And he did not find them; Aunt Nan had her
secrets carefully concealed. But for weeks the
family were continually discovering strange new
surprises in their housekeeping.</p>

<p>That very night at supper, just after Mr.
Griggs had left the house with his kit of tools, a
queer thing happened. They were sitting about
the round dining-table, the center of which, as
they had noticed from the first, seemed to be a
separate inlaid circle of wood. In the middle of
this Mary had set a pretty vase of flowers—nasturtiums,
mignonette, marigolds, and yellow
poppies, the last lingerers in their garden.</p>

<p>They were talking about their first day in
Crowfield, about the visit of Katy Summers,
and the funny things that had happened to their
first caller; and they were all laughing merrily
over Mary’s description of how Katy had looked
when she went riding out toward the door in the
inhospitable chair. Dr. Corliss had just reached
out his hand for the sugar. Suddenly the table
center began slowly to revolve, and the sugar
bowl retreated from his hand as if by magic.</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” said the Doctor. “This is a
new kind of butler’s assistant!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“It makes me feel like Alice in Wonderland!”
exclaimed Mary. “It is the Mad Hatter’s
breakfast; only instead of every one’s moving
on one place, the place moves on by itself!”</p>

<p>They found that Mary had hit her knee by
accident against a spring concealed under the
table.</p>

<p>“Aunt Nan lived here all alone,” said Mrs.
Corliss, “and I dare say she found this an easy
way to pass things to herself when she was eating
her lonely meals.”</p>

<p>“Let’s keep it like this,” said Mary. “Now
I shan’t be needing always to ask John to
pass the salt.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s fair!” protested John.
“Now, Mary has the seat by the button, and
she can make the table turn when she likes. I
wish I had a button, too.”</p>

<p>“You’d keep the table whirling all the time,
John,” laughed his father. “No, it is better as
it is. We chose our seats this way, before we
knew about the lively center-piece. Let’s stick
to what chance gave us. Aunt Nan’s house seems
to be a kind of good-luck game, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>But in spite of the queer things that were continually
happening there, it did not take long for
the Corliss family to feel quite at home in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
old house, and in Crowfield. Mary was admitted
to the High School, and found herself in the
same class with Katy Summers, which pleased
them both very much. They soon became the
closest chums. John went to the Grammar
School, where he found some nice boys of his
own age who lived just down the road; Ralph
and James Perry, cousins in opposite houses,
and Billy Barton a little farther on.</p>

<p>These promptly formed the Big Four; and the
neighborhood of the Big Four was the liveliest
in town. The Corliss house, with its collections
and curiosities, became their favorite meeting-place,
and in these days could hardly recognize
itself with the merry streams of children who
were always running in and out, up and down
the stairs. It was fortunate that Dr. Corliss,
who kept himself shut up in his study with the
book he was writing, was not of a nervous or
easily distracted temperament.</p>

<p>As for Mrs. Corliss—being a mother, she just
smiled and loved everybody. It was her idea
that first of all a home should be a happy place
for the family and for every one who came
there. The first thing she did was to send for
the familiar furniture of the city house which
they had left when Dr. Corliss was obliged to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
give up his professorship in college and move
into the country. Now the queer rooms of
Aunt Nan’s inhospitable old house were much
less queer and much more homelike than they
had ever been, and every corner radiated a
merry hospitality.</p>

<p>But in the library nothing was changed. Mary
would not let anything be moved from the place
in which Aunt Nan had put it. For she had
grown much attached to the old lady’s memory,
since the finding of that little watch and chain.</p>

<p>You may be sure that Mary and John looked
about the library carefully, to see if more of
the same kind of nice joke might not be concealed
somewhere. But they found nothing. It
was not until nearly a week later, when there
came a rainy Saturday, that they found time
to look at the books themselves.</p>

<p>“Hello! Here’s a funny book to find in an
old lady’s library!” cried John. “It’s our old
friend ‘Master Skylark,’ one of the nicest books
I know. But how do you suppose a children’s
book came to be here, Mary? Daddy says for
years Aunt Nan never allowed any children in
the house.”</p>

<p>“I wonder!” said Mary. “And here’s another
child’s book, right here on the desk. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
noticed it the first time I came in here, but I
never opened it before. ‘Shakespeare the Boy’
is the name of it. I wonder if it is interesting?
I like Shakespeare. We read his plays in school,
and once I wrote a composition about him, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Papa says Aunt Nan was crazy about Shakespeare,”
said John.</p>

<p>“Why, here’s a note inside the cover of the
book, addressed to me!” said Mary wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Let me look!” cried John, darting to her side.
“Yes, it’s in that same handwriting, Mary. It’s
a letter from Aunt Nan. Do hurry and open it!”</p>

<p>Mary held the envelope somewhat dubiously.
It was not quite pleasant to be receiving letters
from a person no longer living in this world.
She glanced up at the portrait over the mantel
as she cut the end of the envelope with Aunt
Nan’s desk shears, and it seemed to her that the
eyes under the prim gray curls gleamed at her
knowingly. She almost expected to see the long
forefinger of the portrait’s right hand point directly
at her.</p>

<p>It was a brief letter that Aunt Nan had written;
and it explained why she had left her library
of precious books to this grandniece Mary whom
she had never seen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>Mary Corliss (it began): I shan’t call you dear
Mary because I don’t know whether you are dear
or not. You may be if you like the sort of things
I always liked. And in that case I shall be glad
you have them for your own, when I can no longer
enjoy them. I mean the things in this room, which
I have given all to you, because there is no one
else whom I can bear to think of as handling them.
I heard your father say once that he hated poetry.
That was enough for me! I never wanted to see
him again. He can have my house, but not my
precious books. Well, I read in the paper which
your mother sent me that you had won a prize at
school for a composition about William Shakespeare,
the greatest poet who ever lived. You have
begun well! If you go on, as I did, you will care
as I have cared about everything he wrote. So
you shall have my library and get what you can
out of it. Be kind to the books I have loved.
Love them, if you can, for their own sake.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="indentright">Your Great-Aunt,</span><br>

<span class="smcap">Nan Corliss</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>“What a queer letter!” said John. “So it
was your composition that did it. My! Aren’t
you lucky, Mary!”</p>

<p>“I do like Shakespeare already,” said Mary,
glancing first at Aunt Nan’s portrait, then at the
bust of the poet below it. “And I guess I am
going to like Aunt Nan.” She smiled up at the
portrait, which she now thought seemed to
smile back at her. “I must go and tell Father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
about it,” she said eagerly, running out of the
room; and presently she came back, dragging
him by the hand.</p>

<p>“Well, Mary!” said Dr. Corliss. “So it was
your Shakespeare essay that won you the
library! I remember how fond Aunt Nan used
to be of the Poet. She was always quoting
from him. I am glad you like poetry, my dear;
though for myself I never could understand it.
This is, indeed, a real poetry library. I am glad
she gave it to you instead of to me, Mary. There
are any number of editions of Shakespeare here,
I have noticed, and a lot of books about him,
too. I suppose she would have liked you to read
every one.”</p>

<p>“I mean to,” said Mary firmly. “I want to;
and I am going to begin with this one, ‘Shakespeare
the Boy.’ I feel as if that was what she
meant me to do.”</p>

<p>As she said this Mary began to turn over the
leaves of the book in which she had found the
note from Aunt Nan. “The story sounds very
nice,” she said.</p>

<p>Just then something fell from between the
leaves and fluttered to the floor. Her father
stooped to pick it up.</p>

<p>“Aunt Nan’s bookmark,” he said. “It would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
be nice to keep her marks when you can, Mary.
Why!” he exclaimed suddenly, staring at what
he held in his fingers. It was long and yellow,
and printed on both sides.</p>

<p>“Mary!” he cried, “did you ever see one of
these before? I have never seen many of them
myself, more’s the pity!” And he handed the
“bookmark” to his daughter.</p>

<p>It was a hundred-dollar bill.</p>

<p>“Papa!” gasped Mary, “whose is it?”</p>

<p>“It is yours, Mary, just as much as the watch
and chain were; just as much as the library is,”
said her father. “Everything in the room was
to be yours; Aunt Nan said so in her will. This
is certainly a part of your legacy. I wonder if
Aunt Nan forgot it or put it there on purpose,
as another of her little jokes?”</p>

<p>“I think she put it there on purpose,” said
John. “My! But she was a queer old lady!”</p>

<p>“I think she was a very nice old lady,” said
Mary. “Now I must go and tell Katy Summers
about it.”</p>

<small>INSTRUCTIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WITH the hundred dollars which she had
found in the book Mary started an account
in the Crowfield Savings Bank, under her own
name. She was very proud of her little blue
bank-book, and she hoped that some time, in
some unexpected way, she would save enough
money to go to college, as John was to do.</p>

<p>But the outlook was rather hopeless. The
Corliss family were far from well off. Even in
Crowfield, where expenses were low, they had
a hard time to live on the small income from
what Dr. Corliss had managed to save while he
was Professor of Philosophy in the city college.
Dr. Corliss was writing a book which he hoped
would some day make his fortune. But the book
would not be finished for many a day. Meanwhile,
though there was very little money coming
in, it was steadily going out; as money has
a way of doing.</p>

<p>The best thing the family could do at present
was to save as much as possible by going without
servants and dainties and fine clothes—just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
as people have to do in war-time; and by
doing things themselves, instead of having things
done for them. Mrs. Corliss was a clever manager.
She had learned how to cook and sew and
do all kinds of things with her deft fingers; and
Mary was a good assistant and pupil, while
John did everything that a little boy could do
to help. He ran errands and built the fires, and
even set the table and helped wipe the dishes
when his mother and sister were busy.</p>

<p>The neighbors were very friendly, and there
were so many pleasant new things in Crowfield
that the family did not miss the pleasures they
used to enjoy in the city, nor the pretty clothes
and luxuries which were now out of the question.
And Mary did not spend much time worrying
about college. There would be time enough
for that.</p>

<p>After the finding of that hundred-dollar bill,
Mary and John spent a great deal of time in
opening and shutting the leaves of books in the
library, hoping that they would come upon
other bookmarks as valuable as that first one.
But whether Aunt Nan had left the bill there
by mistake, as Dr. Corliss imagined, or whether
she had put it there on purpose, as Mary liked
to think, apparently the old lady had not repeated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
herself. The only foreign things they
found in the musty old volumes were bits of
pressed flowers and ferns, and now and then a
flattened bug which had been crushed in its
pursuit of knowledge.</p>

<p>John soon grew tired of this fruitless search.
But Mary came upon so many interesting things
in the books themselves that she often forgot
what she was looking for. Many of the books
had queer, old-fashioned pictures; some had
names and dates of long ago written on the fly-leaf.
In many Mary found that Aunt Nan had
scrawled notes and comments—sometimes
amusing and witty; sometimes very hard to
understand.</p>

<p>Mary loved her library. She had never before
had a corner all to herself, except her tiny bedroom.
And to feel that this spacious room, with
everything in it, was all hers, in which to do
just as she pleased, was a very pleasant thing.</p>

<p>“Where’s Mary?” asked Katy Summers one
afternoon, running into the Corliss house without
knocking, as she had earned the right to do.</p>

<p>“I think she is in the library,” said Mrs. Corliss,
who was busy sewing in the living-room.
“That is a pretty likely place in which to look
nowadays, when she isn’t anywhere else!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“Shall I go there to find her?” asked Katy.</p>

<p>“Yes, Dear; go right in,” said Mrs. Corliss.
“She will be glad to see you, I am sure.”</p>

<p>The door of the library was hospitably open.
And Katy Summers, creeping up on tiptoe and
peeping in softly, saw Mary with her thumb
between the leaves of a book, kneeling before
one of the bookshelves.</p>

<p>“I spy!” cried Katy. “What’s the old Bookworm
up to now? Or perhaps I ought to say,
considering your position, what’s she <i>down</i> to
now?”</p>

<p>Mary jumped hastily to her feet. “Hello,
Katy,” she said cordially. “I was just looking
up something. Say, Katy, do you know what
fun it is to look up quotations?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Katy, laughing. “I don’t see any
fun in that. No more fun than looking up things
in a dictionary.”</p>

<p>“Well, it <i>is</i> fun,” returned Mary. “I think I
must be something like Aunt Nan. She loved
quotations. Just look at this row of ‘Gems from
the Poets.’ They’re full of quotations, Katy.
I’m going to read them all, some time.”</p>

<p>“Goodness!” cried Katy. “What an idea! I
think poetry is stupid stuff, sing-song and silly.”</p>

<p>“So Daddy thinks,” said Mary. “But it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
isn’t, really. It is full of the most interesting
stories and legends and beautiful things. This
library bores Daddy almost to death, because
all the books on these two walls are poetry. I
believe that Aunt Nan had the works of every
old poet who ever wrote in the English language.
And see, these are the lives of the poets.” She
pointed to the shelves in one corner.</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Katy. “Well, what of it?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” said Mary, looking up at
Aunt Nan’s portrait, “the more I stay in this
library, the more I like Aunt Nan’s books, and
the more I want to please Aunt Nan herself. I
like her, Katy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t!” said Katy, eyeing the portrait sideways.
“You never had her for a neighbor, you
see.”</p>

<p>“She never did anything to you, did she?”
asked Mary.</p>

<p>“No-o,” drawled Katy reluctantly. “She
never did anything either good or bad to me.
But—she was awfully queer!”</p>

<p>“Of course she was,” agreed Mary. “But
that isn’t the worst thing in the world, to be
queer. And she was awfully kind to me.— Say,
Katy, don’t you like Shakespeare?”</p>

<p>“Not very well,” confessed Katy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“Well, I do,” Mary asserted. “I haven’t
read much of him, but I’m going to. Every
time I look at that head of Shakespeare on the
mantelpiece, I remember that it was my composition
about Shakespeare that was at the bottom
of almost everything nice that has happened
in Crowfield. Why, if it hadn’t been for
him, perhaps we shouldn’t have come to live
here at all, and then I shouldn’t ever have
known <i>you</i>, Katy Summers!”</p>

<p>“Gracious!” exclaimed Katy. “Wouldn’t
that have been awful? Yes, I believe I do like
him a little, since he did <i>that</i>. I wrote a composition
about him once, too. It didn’t bring anything
good in my direction. But then, it wasn’t
a very good composition. I only got a <i>C</i> with it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mary, “I feel as if I owe him
something, and Aunt Nan something. And
sooner or later I’m going to read everything he
ever wrote.”</p>

<p>“Goodness!” said Katy. “Then you’ll never
have time to read anything else, I guess. Look!”— She
pointed around the walls. “Why, there
are hundreds of Shakespeares. Hundreds and
hundreds!”</p>

<p>“They are mostly different editions of the
same thing,” said Mary wisely. “I shan’t have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
to read every edition. There aren’t so very
many books by him, really. Not more than
thirty, I think. I’ve been looking at this little
red set that’s so easy to handle and has such
nice notes. I like the queer spelling. I’m going
to read ‘Midsummer Night’s Dream’ first. I
think that’s what Aunt Nan meant.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ‘<i>what Aunt Nan
meant</i>’?” asked Katy curiously. “Has she written
you another letter?” Mary had told her
about the will.</p>

<p>“No, not exactly,” confessed Mary. “But
see what I found just now when I finished reading
‘Shakespeare the Boy,’—the book that
was lying on her desk with that first note she
wrote me.” And she opened the volume which
she held in her hand at the last page. Below
the word “Finis” were penned in a delicate,
old-fashioned writing these words:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Mem. Read in this order, <i>with notes</i>.</p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>1. Midsummer Night’s Dream.<br>
2. Julius Cæsar.<br>
3. Twelfth Night.<br>
4. Tempest.<br>
5. As You Like It.<br>
6. Merchant of Venice.<br>
7. Hamlet, etc.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“Pooh!” cried Katy. “I don’t believe she
meant that for you, at all! She was just talking
to herself. Let’s see if there was anything written
at the end of ‘Master Skylark.’ Didn’t you
say that was lying on her desk, too?”</p>

<p>They ran to get this other child’s book, which,
queerly enough, had also been left lying on the
desk, as if Aunt Nan had just been reading both.
And there, too, at the end was written exactly
the same list, with the same instructions.</p>

<p>“That settles it!” exclaimed Mary. “She
did mean me to see that list, so she left it in
both those children’s books, which she thought
I would be sure to read first. I am going to read
Shakespeare’s plays in just the order she wished.
I’m going to read my very own books in my
very own library. I’m going to begin this very
afternoon!” Mary was quite excited.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Please not this afternoon!” begged
Katy. “I want you to come with me while I
do an errand at the express office in Ashley. It
is a three-mile walk. I don’t want to go alone.
Please, Mary!”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother!” Mary was about to say; for
she wanted to begin her reading. But she
thought better of it. Katy had been so kind to
her. And, after all, it was a beautiful afternoon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
and the walk would be very pleasant down
a new road which she had never traveled. She
laid down the book reluctantly.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said. “I can read my books any
time, I suppose. Isn’t it nice to think of that?
Yes—I’ll go with you, Katy. It will be fun.
Just wait till I get my hat, and tell Mother.”</p>

<p>“You’re a dear!” burst out Katy, hugging her.</p>

<p>“If I go with you this time, Katy, you’ll have
to read Shakespeare with me another time,” bargained
Mary with good-natured guile.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Katy. “Sometime, when it
is not so nice and crisp and walky out of doors,
as it is to-day.”</p>

<p>And off the two girls started, with comradely
arms about one another’s shoulders.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>THE LANTERN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MARY had no chance to begin reading her
Shakespeare until the following day. But
just as soon as she had finished her French and
algebra home lessons, she laid aside those books
and seized the list which Aunt Nan had made
for her.</p>

<p>“‘Mem. Read in this order—Midsummer
Night’s Dream.’ That sounds good for a beginning,”
she said to herself. “I just love the
name of it. I wonder what it’s about?” Running
to the bookshelves on the left side of the
fireplace, where one whole section was devoted
to the works of William Shakespeare, Mary began
fumbling among the little red books. “Here
is ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’!” said she,
settling herself in the big leather armchair to
read. “Why, it’s full of fairies and private
theatricals! I know it is going to be nice!”</p>

<p>Mary read for some time and found that she
liked the play even better than she had expected.
She always liked to read about fairies,
of whom, indeed, the book was full. And the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
scene of the play-acting was very funny, she
thought, especially where Bottom wanted to
play all the parts himself.</p>

<p>Presently she came to a place in the text where
a line was heavily underscored. It was where
Moon says, “<i>This lantern is my lantern</i>.” “I
wonder why Aunt Nan marked that line?”
thought Mary. She turned to see if there was
anything about a lantern in the notes. And
there she found this remark in the writing which
she had come to recognize as Aunt Nan’s: “<i>See
lantern on mantelshelf.</i> <span class="smcap">Careful!</span>”</p>

<p>“That is a funny note!” thought Mary.
“What mantelshelf? There isn’t any in the
play. Can she mean—why, yes! There’s a
lantern over there on <i>my</i> mantelshelf!”</p>

<p>Sure enough! Mary had not noticed it especially
until this minute. But there, not far
from the bust of Shakespeare, was a queer old
tin lantern, pierced with holes for a candle to
shine through—the very kind that Moon must
have used in the play, in Shakespeare’s day.</p>

<p>Mary dropped the book and went over to the
lantern, with a pleasant sense of possession.
Everything in the room was hers. This would
be just the thing to play Pyramus and Thisbe
with! She took up the old lantern and examined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
it curiously. In the socket was the stub
of a candle. “I wonder who lighted it last?”
thought Mary idly. She tried to pull out the
candle, but it stuck. She pulled harder, and
presently—out it came! There was something
in the socket below—something that rattled.
Mary shook the lantern and out fell a tiny key;
a gilt key with a green silk string tied to the top.
That was all.</p>

<p>“What a funny place for a key!” thought
Mary. “I wonder how it got there.” Then she
thought again of the quotation which had been
underlined—“‘<i>This lantern is my lantern</i>.’ She
wanted me to find it, I am sure!” thought Mary
eagerly. “It is the key to something. Oh, if I
could only find what that is! How in the world
shall I know where to look?”</p>

<p>“Oh, John!” she cried, “John!”—for just then
she heard his whistle in the hall, and she ran
down to show him her find.</p>

<p>Up came John; up the stairs two steps at a
time, with Mary close after him. “I bet I know
what it is!” he cried. “It’s the key to a Secret
Panel. I’ve read about them in books, lots of
times. Let’s hunt till we find the keyhole.”</p>

<p>The wall of the library between the bookshelves
was, indeed, paneled in dark wood, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
the doors. But there was little enough of this
surface, because the built-in bookshelves took
up so much space. With the aid of the library
ladder it took Mary and John comparatively
little time to go over every inch of the paneling
very carefully, thumping the wall with the heel
of Mary’s slipper, to see if it might be hollow.
But no sound betrayed a secret hiding-place. No
scratch or knot concealed a tiny keyhole. Tired
and disgusted at last, they gave up the search.</p>

<p>“I think that’s a pretty poor joke!” said
John. “A key without anything to fit it to is
about as silly as can be!”</p>

<p>“Aunt Nan made some silly jokes in other
parts of the house,” said Mary. “But she hasn’t
done so in the library. I don’t believe she
meant to tease me. Let’s go and tell Father.
Perhaps he will know what it means.” And
forthwith they tripped to the Doctor’s study,
with the key and the lantern and the marked
copy of “Midsummer Night’s Dream,” to puzzle
the Philosopher. They laid the three exhibits
on his desk, and stood off, challenging him
with eager eyes.</p>

<p>Dr. Corliss looked at these things critically;
then he followed them back to the library and
glanced about the walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“Well, Father?” asked Mary at last. “What
do you think it means?”</p>

<p>The Doctor hummed and hawed. “Why, I
think it means that Aunt Nan was playing a
joke on <i>you</i> this time, Mary!” he said, laughing.
“It would be just like her, you know. You
can’t hope to be the only one to escape her
humors. Besides, this key doesn’t look to me
like a real key to anything. You mustn’t expect
too much, my girl, nor get excited over this
legacy of yours, or I shall be sorry you have it.
I suspect there are no more gold watches and
hundred-dollar bills floating around in your
library. It wouldn’t be like Aunt Nan to do
the same thing twice. It was the unexpected
that always pleased her. You had better make
the most of your books for their own sakes,
Mary.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am going to do that,” said Mary,
taking the key from her father and putting the
green string around her neck. “I am going to
wear it as a sort of ‘Midsummer Night’s
Dream’ charm. And I believe that some day
I shall find out the key to the key, if I look long
enough.”</p>

<p>“If you read long enough, perhaps you may,”
said her father, laughing. “I have heard that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
they find queer things in Shakespeare sometimes—ciphers
and things like that. But I
never had time to study them up. A cipher is
<i>nothing</i> to me.” And he chuckled at his little
joke.</p>

<p>“If I read long enough, perhaps I may find
out something. That’s so!” said Mary. “I’ll
keep on reading.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! That’s a slow way!” said John. “If
there was anything in <i>my</i> library, I’d want to
find it out right away!”</p>

<p>“If she has put anything in my library, that
isn’t the way Aunt Nan meant me to find it,”
retorted Mary. “I am going to do what Aunt
Nan wanted, if I can discover what that is.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Mary!” said her father. “I
believe you are on the right track.”</p>

<p>Just at this moment there was a queer
sound, apparently in one corner of the room.</p>

<p>“Hark!” said Dr. Corliss. “What was that,
Mary?”</p>

<p>“It sounded like something rapping on the
floor!” said John, with wide eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hear sounds like that quite often,”
said Mary carelessly. “At first it frightened
me, but I have got used to it. I suppose it
must be a rat in the cellar.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Yes, I dare say it is a rat,” said her father.
“Old houses like this have strange noises, often.
But I have never seen any rats.”</p>

<p>“It sounded too big for a rat,” declared
John. “Aren’t you afraid, Mary?”</p>

<p>“No,” declared Mary; “I’m not afraid,
whether it’s a rat or not. Some way, I think
I couldn’t be afraid in this room.”</p>

<p>“I thought girls were always afraid of rats,”
murmured John.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>CALIBAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WITH rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes Mary
returned from a walk with Katy Summers.
It had been pleasant but uneventful.
Just as she turned in at the little dooryard of
home, she thought she spied a black Something
dart like a shadow across the little strip of
green beside the house.</p>

<p>“It looks like a cat,” said Mary to herself. “I
will see where it went to.” She followed to the
end of the house, where the shape had seemed
to disappear. There was nothing to be seen.
She went around the ell, and back to the front of
the house again. Still there was no trace of the
little shadow that had streaked into invisibility.</p>

<p>“If it was not my imagination, it must have
gone under the house,” said Mary to herself.
“Two or three times I have thought I spied a
black blur in the act of disappearing; and I believe
we are haunted by something on four legs.
I will ask the family.”</p>

<p>That night at the supper-table she broached
the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“Mother, have you ever seen a cat about the
place—a black cat, a swift cat, a cat that never
stays for a second in one spot—a mysterious
cat that is gone as soon as you see it?”</p>

<p>“That sounds spooky enough!” commented
Dr. Corliss. “You make the shivers run down
my sensitive spine!”</p>

<p>“I have not seen any cat,” said Mrs. Corliss.
“I think you must be mistaken, Mary.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve seen a cat!” volunteered John,—“a
thin black cat, oh, so thin! I saw him run
across the lawn once; and once I saw him crouching
down by the lilac bush near the back door. I
think he was catching mice.”</p>

<p>“Then there <i>is</i> a cat,” said Mary. “I thought
I might be dreaming. He must be very wild.
I believe he lives under our house.”</p>

<p>“Under the house!” exclaimed Mrs. Corliss.
“Surely, we should all have seen him if he lived
so near. I can’t think he could have escaped
my eyes. But now, I remember, I have heard
strange noises in the cellar once or twice.”</p>

<p>“I have, often,” said Mary, “under my
library.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it is a witch-cat!” suggested Dr.
Corliss, pretending to look frightened. “You
people are all so fond of poetry and ravens and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
mystery and magics—you attract strange doings,
you see. Maybe Aunt Nan had a witch-cat
who helped her play tricks on the ever-to-be-surprised
world.”</p>

<p>“Daddy!” cried John, “there’s no such thing
as a witch-cat, is there, truly?”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” laughed his mother. “Daddy
is only joking. And now I come to think of it,
I have wondered why the scraps I put out for
the birds always vanished so quickly. A hungry
cat prowling about would explain everything.”</p>

<p>“It might be Aunt Nan’s cat,” said Mary
thoughtfully. “Poor thing! He might have run
away when he couldn’t find Aunt Nan any
more. He might have been frightened, and
have hid under the house.”</p>

<p>“I think in that case he would have starved
to death in all these weeks,” said Mrs. Corliss.
“Besides, I should think the neighbors would
have told us, or that Aunt Nan herself would
have left some word.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to find out, if I can,” said Mary.
“If it’s Aunt Nan’s cat I want to be good to
him. We want to be good to him, anyway, don’t
we?”</p>

<p>“Of course we do,” said Mrs. Corliss. “But
there is nothing so hard to tame as a wild cat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>Katy Summers knew nothing of any cat belonging
to Miss Corliss. Neither did the other
neighbors.</p>

<p>That next day on coming home from school
Mary again spied the cat. Just as she clicked
the gate she saw the long, black shape scurry
across the lawn and vanish under the ell, under
Mary’s library. Mary tiptoed to the house and,
stooping, called gently, “Kitty! Kitty! Kitty!”</p>

<p>At first there was no response. But presently
there came a feeble and doleful “Miaou!” And
Mary thought she could catch the gleam of two
green eyes glaring out of the darkness.</p>

<p>“I must get him something to eat,” said Mary.
“Perhaps I can tempt him to make friends.”
And running into the house she returned with a
saucer of milk and a bit of meat, which she set
down close to the house. “Kitty! Kitty! Kitty!”
she called, in a tone of invitation.</p>

<p>“Miaou!” cried the forlorn cat again. But
he did not come forth from his hiding-place.</p>

<p>“I shall have to go away, and give him a
chance to eat when I am not by,” thought Mary.
And this she did. From her chamber window
she could just manage to watch the hole under
the ell. After a long time she was rewarded by
seeing the cat’s head emerge from the hole. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
a minute he stared around with wild eyes, his
body ready to spring. But finding himself safe,
he hungrily seized the meat and retreated with
it under the house. Presently he came out
again, licking his chops eagerly, and began to
lap the milk, retreating every now and then as
if some fancied sound alarmed him. The poor
creature’s sides were so thin that he resembled
a cut-out pasteboard cat. His tail was like that
of a long black rat. He seemed to be wearing a
collar about his neck.</p>

<p>“He must have been somebody’s pet cat,” said
Mary to herself. “I must try to tame him.”</p>

<p>But it took a great deal of time and patience
to make friends with the poor black pussy,
which had evidently been greatly frightened
and almost starved. Day after day Mary set
out the saucer of milk and a bit of meat. And
each time she did so, she talked kindly to the cat
hidden under the house, hoping that he would
come out while she was still there. But it was
many days before she got more than the mournful
“Miaou!” in answer to her coaxing words.</p>

<p>At last, one day, after waiting a long time beside
the saucer of milk and a particularly savory
plate of chicken-bones, Mary was rewarded by
seeing the cat timidly thrust out his head while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
she was talking. He drew back almost immediately.
But finally the smell of the chicken
tempted him beyond caution, and he got up
courage to face this stranger who seemed to show
no evil intentions. He snatched a chicken-bone
and vanished. But this was the beginning of
friendship.</p>

<p>The next day the cat came out almost immediately
when Mary called him. Presently he would
take things from her hand, timidly at first, then
with increasing confidence, when he found that
nothing dreadful happened. But still Mary had
no chance to examine the collar, on which she
saw that there were some words engraved.</p>

<p>At last came a day when the cat let Mary
stroke his fur, now grown much sleeker and
covering a plumper body. And from that time
it became easier to make friends. Soon Mary
held the creature on her lap for a triumphant
minute. And the next day she had a chance to
examine the engraved collar. On the silver plate
was traced,—“<i>Caliban. Home of N. Corliss.
Crowfield</i>.”</p>

<p>“He was Aunt Nan’s cat!” cried Mary in excitement.
And she ran into the house with the
news.</p>

<p>Mrs. Corliss was astonished. “We must make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Caliban feel at home again,” she said. “He
must have had a terrible fright. But we will
help him to forget that before long.”</p>

<p>In a little while Mary succeeded in coaxing
Caliban into the house. And once inside he did
not behave like a stranger. For a few moments,
indeed, he hesitated, cringing as if in fear of
what might happen. But presently he raised
his head, sniffed, and, looking neither to right
nor left, marched straight toward the library.
Mary tiptoed after him, in great excitement.
Caliban went directly to the big armchair beside
the desk, sniffed a moment at the cushion,
then jumped up and curled himself down for a
nap, giving a great sigh of contentment. From
that moment he accepted partnership with
Mary in the room and all its contents.</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” cried Mrs. Corliss, who had
followed softly. “The cat is certainly at home.
I wonder how he ever happened to go away? I
suppose we shall never know.”</p>

<p>And they never did. They made inquiries of
the neighbors. But nobody could tell them anything
definite about Aunt Nan’s cat. Some persons
had, indeed, seen a big black creature stalking
about the lawn in the old lady’s time, and had
not liked the look of him, as they said. But as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
Miss Corliss had never had anything to do with
her neighbors, so her cat seemed to have followed
her example. And when Aunt Nan’s day
was over, the cat simply disappeared.</p>

<p>Caliban must have lived precariously by
catching mice and birds. But he never deserted
the neighborhood of the old house when the
new tenants came to live there; though it took
him some time to realize that these were relatives
of his mistress whom he might trust.</p>

<p>Once more an inmate of the house, Caliban
never wandered again. He adopted Mary as
his new mistress, and allowed her to take all
kinds of liberties with him. But to the rest of
the family he was always rather haughty and
stand-offish. John never quite got rid of the idea
that Caliban was a witch-cat. And sometimes
he had a rather creepy feeling when the great
black cat blinked at him with his green eyes.</p>

<p>But Mary said it was all nonsense. “He’s just
a dear, good, soft pussy-cat,” she cried one day,
hugging the now plump and handsome Caliban
in her arms.</p>

<p>And Caliban, stretching out a soft paw, laid
it lovingly against his little mistress’s cheek.</p>

<p>But John vowed that at the same moment
Caliban winked wickedly at him!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>THE BUST</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR some weeks life went on quietly for the
Corliss family, made more interesting by
the coming of Caliban, who resembled his late
mistress in some unexpected qualities. But the
family had got used to being surprised by Aunt
Nan’s jokes, so that they were no longer jokes
at all. And nothing further of a mysterious nature
happened in Mary’s library, so that everybody
had about forgotten the excitement of
the watch, the bookmark, and the unexplained
key.</p>

<p>The more Mary read her Shakespeare, the
better she liked the plays, which, as she said,
were “just full of familiar quotations!” Caliban
approved heartily of Mary’s reading. He
liked nothing better than to curl up in her lap
while she sat in the big easy-chair, with her book
resting on its broad arm; and his rumbling purr
made a pleasant accompaniment whenever she
read aloud. For Mary liked to read aloud to
herself and to him. It made her understand the
story so much better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>Probably Caliban was used to assisting Aunt
Nan in this same way. He was truly a cat of
fine education. Mary wondered if he knew all
the books in the library. “He looks wise enough
to,” she thought.</p>

<p>“I think Caliban likes some plays better than
others,” she confided to her mother. “He didn’t
seem to care so much for ‘Midsummer
Night’s Dream,’ But then, I had almost finished
it before he came. He was crazy over
‘Julius Cæsar,’—you ought to have heard him
purr at Marc Antony’s great speech! And now
that I have begun ‘The Tempest,’ he gets so
excited, Mother!”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Mrs. Corliss; “that’s where
he comes in, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mary. “Oh, Mumsie, I was so
surprised when I found Caliban’s name in the
list of characters! I just shouted it right out;
and you ought to have seen Caliban arch his
neck and rub his head against me, and purr like
a little furnace. I’m sure he knew it was <i>his</i>
play. And isn’t it a lovely play, Mother? I
like it best of all.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said her mother.</p>

<p>One day Mary coaxed Katy Summers home
with her after school. “The time has come for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
you to keep your promise, Katy,” said Mary.
“You’ve got to listen to Shakespeare now.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Katy resignedly. “I suppose
I must, sooner or later.”</p>

<p>“I am going to read you some of ‘The Tempest,’”
said Mary. “I want you to like it as
well as I do.”</p>

<p>“You know I never cared for poetry,” said
Katy doubtfully.</p>

<p>“But you will care for <i>this</i>,” said Mary positively,
“especially if you hear it read. That’s the
way everybody ought to know poetry, I think.
Why, even Caliban likes to hear me read poetry.
See, here he comes to listen.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, at the sound of Mary’s voice
Caliban had come running into the library with
a little purr. He looked very handsome and
fluffy these days. Waving his tail majestically,
he jumped up into Mary’s lap and sat on her
knee blinking his green eyes at Katy as if to say,
“Now you are going to hear something fine!”</p>

<p>“I believe John is right,” said Katy. “He
does look like a witch-cat. He’s too knowing
by half! I suppose I shall have to like the
reading, if he says so.” Katy was just a bit jealous
of Mary’s new friend.</p>

<p>“Of course Caliban knows what is best!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
chuckled Mary. “Now, listen, Katy.” And
she began to read the beautiful lines. Presently
she caught up with her own bookmark,
and went on with scenes which she had not read
before. Mary read very nicely, and Katy listened
patiently, while Caliban purred more and
more loudly, “knitting” with busy paws on
Mary’s knees.</p>

<p>After a while Katy saw Mary’s eyes grow
wide, and she paused in the reading, ceasing to
stroke Caliban’s glossy fur. Caliban looked up
at her and stopped purring, as if to say, “What
is it, little Mistress?”</p>

<p>“What is the matter? Go on, Mary,” cried
Katy. “I like it!”</p>

<p>“It’s a Song,” said Mary, in a queer voice,
“and words of it are underlined, Katy, in the
same way that the other place I told you of was
underlined.”</p>

<p>Katy nodded eagerly. She had heard about
the clue to the finding of the key. “What does
it say?” she asked.</p>

<p>And Mary read the lines of the Song:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Full fathom five thy father lies;</div>
<div class="indent"><i>Of his bones are coral made</i>;</div>
<div class="verse"><i>Those are pearls, that were his eyes</i>;</div>
<div class="indent">Nothing of him that doth fade,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
<div class="verse">But doth suffer a sea-change</div>
<div class="verse">Into <i>something rich and strange</i>.</div>
<div class="verse">Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell;</div>
<div class="verse">Hark! now I hear them—Ding-dong, bell!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“It’s lovely!” cried Katy. “And which lines
are underscored, Mary?”</p>

<p>“‘<i>Of his bones are coral made</i>,’ and ‘<i>Those are
pearls that were his eyes</i>,’ and ‘<i>something rich
and strange</i>.’ Oh, Katy, what do you suppose
Aunt Nan meant this time?” said Mary with
eager eyes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i077.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p class="caption">“OH, KATY, WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE AUNT NAN MEANT<br>
THIS TIME?”</p>

<p>At this point Caliban arched his back and
yawned prodigiously, then jumped down on
the floor and sat at Mary’s feet, switching
his tail.</p>

<p>“Hurry and look at the notes at the end of
the book, Mary!” cried Katy, almost as much
excited as her friend. “I did not know that
poetry could be so interesting.”</p>

<p>Mary turned hastily to the back of the book.
In the margin beside the printed notes were
penned several words; references to other plays
which evidently Aunt Nan wanted Mary to look
up. “Bother!” said Mary in disappointment;
“it’s only more quotations. I don’t want to
stop for <i>them</i>.”</p>

<p>“You had better, Mary,” suggested Katy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
“Perhaps if you do they will give you still another
clue. See how queer Caliban looks!”</p>

<p>The cat was looking up in Mary’s face expectantly;
and when she stooped to pat him,
he opened his mouth and gave a strange, soundless
“Miaou!”</p>

<p>“It looked as if he said ‘Yes!’ didn’t it,
Katy?” said Mary. “Well, then, I suppose I
had better do it. The first reference is to ‘As
You Like It,’ Act <span class="allsmcap">II</span>, Scene i.”</p>

<p>Mary went to the Shakespeare shelf, found
the volume quickly, and looked up the proper
place. “Yes!” she exclaimed, “there is a line
underscored here, too,—‘<i>Wears yet a precious
jewel in his head</i>.’ What a queer saying, Katy!
What do you suppose it means? And this
is the next quotation, in the ‘Sonnets’—Number
<span class="allsmcap">CXXXV</span>, Line 1. Here it is! ‘<i>Whoever has
her wish, you have your Will.</i>’ Now, what
connection can there be between those two
things, Katy?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know!” said Katy, disappointed.
“Is that all, are you sure? It doesn’t seem to
mean anything, does it?”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” added Mary. “Here in the
Sonnet-margin she has written, ‘<i>Will S.—Yours.
Look!</i>’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>“Look where?” wondered Katy. “What <i>Will
S.</i> have you, Mary?”</p>

<p>At the word “<i>Look!</i>” Mary had glanced up
at the portrait of Aunt Nan, and it seemed to
her as if the eyes in the picture were cast down
on something below them. Mary’s own eyes
followed the look, and fell on the bust of Shakespeare
in the middle of the mantelshelf. “Does
she mean—perhaps she does—that bust of
Will Shakespeare?” said Mary. “It is mine now,
of course. ‘<i>Whoever has her wish</i>’—‘<i>Wears yet
a precious jewel in his head</i>’—‘<i>Something rich
and strange</i>.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary! It all fits together!” cried Katy,
clapping her hands. “Do have a look at that
bust, dear! If it is your Will.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I will do!” cried Mary,
running to the mantelpiece, with Katy close behind
her, and Caliban following them both.</p>

<p>The bust was a plaster one about six inches
high, and it stood on a black marble block like
a little pedestal. Mary had dusted it many times
and she knew it was not fastened to the pedestal
and that it was hollow. But was it also empty?</p>

<p>While the girls were looking at the bust, Caliban
suddenly made two leaps, one to a chair,
then to the mantelshelf which he reached without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
a slip. Then he took up his pose beside the
bust of Shakespeare, and sat blinking wisely at
them.</p>

<p>“Do look at Caliban!” cried Katy. “He certainly
looks as if he knew secrets!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he does,” said Mary. “Maybe
there is a secret about this bust. I am going to
see. If you please, Master Will S.”</p>

<p>She took down the bust and shook it gently.
Nothing rattled inside. Nothing fell out. She
poked with her finger as far as she could reach.
There seemed to be nothing in the interior.</p>

<p>“Try again, Mary,” begged Katy, producing
something from her pocket. “Here’s my folding
button-hook.” Cautiously Mary thrust the
hook up into the place where the brains of
William S. would have been, were they not distributed
about the library instead in the form
of books.</p>

<p>Yes! There was something up in the head;
something that was yielding to the touch of the
steel; something that came out at last in her
hand. It was a piece of soft chamois-skin, folded
and tied with green silk cord like that on which
hung the mysterious key.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary!” cried Katy, holding her breath.
“What is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“Sh!” said Mary, with shining eyes. Cautiously
she undid the little packet; and there
inside was another packet, wrapped in silver
foil, very tiny, very hard. Mary squeezed it
gently, but the feeling gave no clue as to the
contents.</p>

<p>While Katy watched her with bulging eyes,
Mary peeled off the silver paper, a bit at a time.
First of all was revealed a pink bead; more
pink beads; a whole necklace, strung on a pink
thread, of the most beautiful coral.</p>

<p>“Miaou!” cried Caliban suddenly.</p>

<p>“Oh-h!” cried Katy. “I never saw anything
so sweet!”</p>

<p>“‘<i>Of his bones are coral made</i>,’” quoted Mary.
“Oh, clever Aunt Nan!— What else?” for the
next quotation was running in her head, and
she was very eager. With trembling fingers she
unwrapped the rest of the package, and brought
to light a tiny pasteboard box of not more than
an inch in any dimension.</p>

<p>“I know what it is!” whispered Katy.</p>

<p>But she gasped when she saw what really
came out—yes, a ring, on a white velvet bed.
But such a ring! It had two big pearls in it,
side by side, as big as the end of Mary’s little
finger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“Oh!” cried Mary with delight. “What a
beautiful ring! I do love pearls.—‘<i>Those are
pearls which were his eyes</i>,’ Katy, do you see?
And this is the ‘<i>something rich and strange</i>.’
What fun it is to find a treasure all by the aid of
lovely quotations!”</p>

<p>“I think it is wonderful!” said Katy. “It is
so poetic.”</p>

<p>“Come; let’s show these to Father and
Mother,” said Mary, giving Caliban a big hug.
And off the two girls ran to exhibit the treasures.</p>

<p>Mrs. Corliss was delighted with her daughter’s
find. “I am glad you have the pretty
necklace to wear with your best dresses,” she
said. “It is very nice and suitable for a schoolgirl.
But the pearl ring—I think we must put
that away until you are older. It is too valuable
and too conspicuous. I don’t like to see
little girls wearing jewelry.”</p>

<p>“I can wear it when I go to college—if I go;
may I not, Mother?” asked Mary wistfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, <i>if</i> you go to college, Dearie,” sighed
her mother. “At any rate, you can wear it when
you are eighteen.”</p>

<p>Dr. Corliss examined the ring carefully.
“Yes, I am sure I have seen Aunt Nan wear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
it,” he said. “It must be one of the set of
famous pearls that she was once proud of.
Doubtless she sold the rest long ago and gave
the money to her hospital. I am glad Mary has
this; but Mother is right. School-girls should
not wear jewelry. Put it away until you are
grown-up, my daughter.”</p>

<p>So Mary fastened the pretty necklace about
her round throat, and shut the pearl ring away
in her bureau drawer, with a sigh.</p>

<p>But Katy Summers said:—</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind, Mary, even if you can’t
wear it yet. Just to think that you have it, and
that you got it in such a mysterious way! Why,
it is like a story-book!”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it make you want to hear some
more Shakespeare?” demanded Mary, laughing.</p>

<p>“Indeed it does!” agreed Katy. “I’ll come
and listen whenever you will let me. Who knows
what may happen? Yes, I’ll wager that Caliban
knows.”</p>

<p>“The same thing never happens twice,” sighed
Mary.</p>

<p>John was disgusted when he came home from
a meeting of the Big Four to find that he had
missed this most exciting discovery; although,
after all, when it came to the jewelry, John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
thought the result rather small. “My goodness,
Mary!” he exclaimed, “I’ll bet there are
lots more things hidden in that old library of
yours. Don’t you go and do all the hunting
when I’m not here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” said Mary. “I didn’t mean to
hunt. I don’t ever mean to hunt. But if things
come—all right.”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d let me have the fun of hunting
in the library all I want, just once,” said John
wistfully.</p>

<p>Mary hesitated. She did not want anybody
to rummage among her books. But she hated
to be “stingy,” and she felt as if she were really
having more than her share of fun out of Aunt
Nan’s legacy, in spite of John’s two thousand
dollars. So she said generously, without letting
John see how great an effort it was: “All right,
Johnny. To-morrow is Saturday, and I’ll give
you free leave to hunt all you want to in my
library. I won’t even come to bother you.”</p>

<p>“Bully for you!” crowed John. “Finding’s
having?”</p>

<p>But that was more than Mary bargained
for.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, John!” she cried. “I don’t think
Aunt Nan would like that. Do you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“Oh, bother! I suppose not,” grumbled John.
“She was a queer one!”</p>

<p>The next Saturday morning John spent in
hunting that library from floor to ceiling. Caliban,
sitting on a corner of the mantelpiece,
watched him gravely during the whole operation,
but offered no suggestions. John poked
behind the books, in every corner, under every
rug. He even ripped open a bit of the cover on
the old sofa. But nothing interesting could he
find.</p>

<p>“I say, Caliban, can’t you help me?” he said
once, to the watching cat.</p>

<p>But Caliban only blinked, and gave his tail
a little switch.</p>

<p>“I’ll give it up!” growled John at last, disgustedly,
when Mary came to call him to dinner.
“I guess you’ve got about all you are ever going
to get out of Aunt Nan’s legacy. If Caliban
knows anything more about it he won’t tell <i>me</i>.
Anyway, I’ve got my two thousand, and that’s
best of all.”</p>

<p>“All right, John,” retorted Mary good-naturedly.
“I’ve got my two thousand books, anyway,
and Caliban. So I am not complaining.”</p>

<p>She did not tell John that she still hoped to
solve the mystery of the key on the green silk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
cord; not to solve it by hunting or by hurrying,
but in Aunt Nan’s own way, whatever that
might be.</p>

<p>And Caliban, looking up at her, switched his
tail and gave a wise, solemn wink.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE ATTIC</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Corliss family were sadly in need of
funds. There were the butcher and the
baker and the candlestick-maker politely presenting
their bills to the family recently arrived
in Crowfield, suggesting in print and in writing
and by word of mouth that “bills are payable
monthly.” Now it was the end of the month,
and there was no money to pay these same bills;
for the expense of moving and settling in a new
place had been heavy, and their small income
had already disappeared.</p>

<p>“How much money is it that we need for immediate
bills, Mother?” asked Dr. Corliss wearily.
It always tired him to talk about money.</p>

<p>“Just about a hundred dollars would bridge
us over nicely,” said his wife, with an anxious
pucker in her forehead. “But I don’t see any
sign of our getting that hundred dollars for a
month to come. And then it will be needed for
fresh bills.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, you must take my hundred
dollars that I found in Aunt Nan’s book,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
said Mary cheerfully, though it cost her a pang
to think of using up her wonder-gift so soon in
this way. “I’ll just take it out of the bank next
Saturday morning.”</p>

<p>“I hate to touch that money of yours, Mary,
even if we put it back for you when we can,”
sighed her mother. “I hoped we could save that
for your nest-egg toward a college fund. Let
me think it over a bit longer. Perhaps something
will happen to help us. Or I may think
of some way to earn the money.”</p>

<p>They left discussion of the matter for that
time. But they all took the troublesome problem
away with them into their daily tasks.</p>

<p>“It is a shame for Mary to have to give up
her hundred dollars,” thought John. “I wish
I could help earn some money so that she needn’t
do it. If I was in the city I could sell
papers or something. But what can I do here
when I have to go to school every day? School
takes up such a lot of time!”</p>

<p>John sighed as he swung his books over his
shoulder and started off for school. All day he
thought about that needed money; and it was
in his mind when he turned in at the gate that
night.</p>

<p>“I wish I was clever and could think up something,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
said John to Caliban, who was sitting on
the top step looking at him when John came in.
“I wonder you don’t help us, Caliban. Come,
now, can’t you think of something, old witch-cat?”</p>

<p>Caliban did not seem to mind being spoken
to in this impolite way. But he did look at John
in a fashion that the boy thought very knowing,
and he did unmistakably wink one eye.</p>

<p>“Miaou!” said Caliban, and he turned his
back on John, and began to walk upstairs.</p>

<p>John was going upstairs too; so he followed
Caliban, who, however, hopped three steps at
a time, while John could only take two with his
short legs. When they reached the top of the
flight, Caliban looked about to see if John was
still following him. John had not meant to do
so, but when he saw Caliban turn and look,
with that queer expression in his green eyes,
John had an idea.</p>

<p>“Maybe he wants me to follow him,” said he
to himself. He tossed his books on to a chair
and tiptoed after the big black cat. Caliban
ambled unconcernedly along the hall and suddenly
darted up the attic stairs. “Hello!” said
John, with a whistle under his breath. “What
is Caliban up to now? I thought he never went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
far from Mary’s library. But, I declare, he is
coaxing me to follow him up into the attic! You
bet I’ll follow you, old boy!”</p>

<p>John had never paid much attention to the
attic. He had looked into it, of course. But it
was so dark and dusty and cobwebby that it
was not much fun poking about up there. Since
their first visit the family had not been there except
to store away some of Aunt Nan’s superfluous
old furniture and ornaments.</p>

<p>If the house had seemed like a museum to the
family when they first entered it, this attic
looked like a junk-shop. Every corner was filled
with furniture, boxes, bundles, strange garments
hanging from hooks, bales bursting with
mysterious contents. Away back in the dusty
corners, where it was so dark that John’s eye
could not distinguish, bulked other dim shapes.</p>

<p>Caliban walked across the floor in a furtive
fashion, then suddenly made a dive into a distant
dark corner, where John immediately heard
a scurrying and scratching.</p>

<p>“He’s after a mouse!” thought John excitedly.
And he, too, dived into the darkness after the
cat, who had disappeared. But Caliban had
scuttled into some hole too small for John to
enter. John could hear him still scratching and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
sniffing. And an occasional squeak betrayed
the misfortune of some long-tailed dweller in the
garret that Caliban had taken by surprise.</p>

<p>John got down on his hands and knees the
better to investigate that corner. But still he
could not spy the cat and his prey. He only
bumped his nose against the low beams, and got
his mouth full of cobwebs. But in that dark hiding-place
he came upon an unexpected thing.
This was something that at first he took to be
a bicycle. But he soon found by feeling of it
that there was but one wheel, and that it was
made of wood. At one end was a curious bunch
of what felt like long hair; it made John shudder.
But presently he remembered.</p>

<p>“It must be a spinning-wheel,” said John to
himself. “I remember seeing one in the picture
of Priscilla and John Alden.” Just then he
bumped his head on something hard. “What
is this great long-handled pan?” he said. “I’ve
seen those in the curiosity shops, too. Hello!
Here’s a cradle, the kind that rocks. I’ve seen
those in pictures. And here’s a pair of andirons.
My! this is a regular old curiosity shop.
These things must be worth a lot of money.”</p>

<p>Then a sudden wonderful idea popped into
John’s head. “Why can’t we sell them, if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
are worth a lot of money? Why, of course we
can sell them, and save Mary’s hundred dollars!
Maybe that is just what old Caliban knew, when
he coaxed me to follow him up here. Say, you old
rascal, where are you? Here, ’Ban! ’Ban! Come
on out and let me see what you think about it!”</p>

<p>But Caliban had disappeared with his mouse,
or whatever it was, which had ceased to squeak.
And there was nothing but darkness and silence
in the old attic beside the little boy and that
strange litter of ancient things.</p>

<p>John looked around and shivered. “I guess
I’ll be going,” he said. “I won’t stop to examine
anything more. They all belong to Mother.
I’ll let her do the looking-up. I’ll run down
and tell her what I’ve found.”</p>

<p>And hurrying as fast as he could out of the
dark corner, where the cobwebs and the dust
were trying to keep intruders away from the
old things to which they clung, John made for
the attic stairs. Two or three times he thought
he heard strange noises behind him, and he
couldn’t go fast enough. Probably it was Caliban
still scratching in some dark subway under
the rafters. But John had no wish to stop and
investigate. He came clattering down the stairs,
and burst into his mother’s room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“Mother!” he cried, “I’ve found something!”</p>

<p>“Goodness, John!” she said. “What a dirty
face you have, and your eyebrows are all cobwebby.
Where in the world have you been, and
what have you found?”</p>

<p>“I’ve found things up in the attic!” exclaimed
John triumphantly. “Caliban showed me the
way. It was all his doings. I think he did it on
purpose—to help Mary.”</p>

<p>“To help Mary! What in the world do you
mean?” cried Mrs. Corliss. “Have you found a
treasure, John, or some more mysterious secrets?”</p>

<p>“Well, no, not exactly,” confessed John,
somewhat crestfallen. “Unless we make it a
secret. I’d like that. But I think it’s a nice surprise,
Mumsie, and I <i>think</i> it will save some of
Mary’s hundred dollars. Mother,—all the
furniture belongs to you, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, Johnny,” she answered, wondering.
“Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said John importantly, “I have
been snooping around the attic, Mumsie, and I
think there are a lot of things you can sell.”</p>

<p>“What kind of things do you mean, John?”
she asked, looking interested.</p>

<p>“Why, you know, Mother,” said John, “there’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
a lot of old truck in the corners up there that
looks just like the stuff we used to see in the
curiosity shops in the city. I didn’t look very
far, Mumsie, ’cause it was so—well, so dirty
in there. But there’s wheels and andirons and
things that I bet are worth lots of money!”</p>

<p>“Are there, John?” said Mrs. Corliss. “How
clever of you to think of it! I never dreamed of
looking in Aunt Nan’s attic to find the way out
of our difficulty. Perhaps this is the solution!”</p>

<p>“It’s Caliban’s idea,” said John, wishing to
be fair and not to claim too much credit, but
feeling well pleased with himself, just the same.</p>

<p>“Let’s go up right away and see what we can
find; shall we, John?” said his mother. “I can’t
wait!”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed John. “But you’d better
take a candle, Mumsie. It’s terribly dark and
spooky up there. And noises sound louder in
the dark.”</p>

<p>Back to the garret they went, Mrs. Corliss
as eager as John. And into those dark corners
which had been undisturbed for many, many
years they shed the light of their blinking, inquisitive
candle. Mrs. Corliss was more thorough
than John had cared to be. She untied
strings, and lifted lids of trunks, and unwrapped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
coverings. Out of chests and bundles and crates
they dragged things that had been waiting
through generations of Aunt Nan’s ancestors
for some one to make them useful; things that
had been discarded or pushed back still farther
in order to make room for her whims and “jokes.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i097.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p class="caption">THINGS THAT HAD BEEN WAITING THROUGH GENERATIONS<br>
OF AUNT NAN’S ANCESTORS FOR SOME ONE TO<br>
MAKE THEM USEFUL</p>

<p>Besides the old spinning-wheel, andirons, and
warming-pan, they found parts of a four-post
bedstead, a tall clock, and many quaint chairs.
They unearthed a hair trunk, foot-warmers,
mirrors, crockery, and lamps with prisms dangling;
shawls and bonnets and carpet-bags. All of
these things were old and most of them were
ugly. But Mrs. Corliss knew that they would
look beautiful to many persons, just because
they were old; which seemed to John a strange
reason.</p>

<p>When they had brought all this old stuff together
in the middle of the attic floor, Mrs.
Corliss looked about and smiled through a face-veil
of dusty cobwebs.</p>

<p>“Well, John!” she said, “I believe my part
of the legacy is not to be laughed at, either.
We don’t want to keep these old things, for
they have no history for us and they are not
beautiful in themselves—the only two excuses
I see for cherishing useless old things. Luckily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
there are plenty of people who think differently.
I’ll go up to town to-morrow with a list of what
you and I have found, and see what I can get
for them at some reliable antique shop. Let’s
keep it a secret, and surprise your father and
Mary, if we have good luck with the venture.
Shall we?”</p>

<p>“Let’s!” cried John, clapping his hands.</p>

<p>Just then out of the darkness crept Caliban,
licking his chops, and looking very sly.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t you go and tell Mary, Caliban!”
charged John. “For this is our secret. You
let me into it yourself, and you’ve got to be our
partner now. Don’t you dare even to <i>purr</i> about
it!”</p>

<p>Caliban did not promise; but he trotted downstairs
before them very discreetly. And all that
evening no one would have guessed by the manner
of those three conspirators what a tremendous
secret they were concealing in their hearts.
John did not dare to look at his mother’s face,
however, he was so bursting with importance.</p>

<p>The next day Mrs. Corliss went to town on
an errand which she explained rather vaguely
to the rest of the family. She returned with
a queer little old man with round shoulders and
a white beard, who spoke English strangely and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
whose hands were not very clean. Mrs. Corliss
took him straight up to the attic, which was the
only part of the house he seemed anxious to
visit. They stayed up there some time, and
there was a great noise of pushing and rolling of
furniture. When they came down, the little old
man was looking very much pleased and rubbing
his dirty hands together. And he went away
still rubbing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Corliss came to the supper-table with
something which she fluttered triumphantly
before the eyes of her bewildered family.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” she cried. “I’ve got it!”</p>

<p>“What is it, Mother?” said Mary.</p>

<p>“How much is it, Mumsie?” begged John at
the same minute.</p>

<p>“It is a check for a hundred dollars!” cried
Mrs. Corliss. “It’s to pay the horrid bills. Hurrah!”</p>

<p>“Where in the world did you get it?” asked
Dr. Corliss. “Is it another of Mary’s bookmarks?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it!” sang Mrs. Corliss. “Mary’s
bookmark is all her own, safe in bank. I got
this out of the attic—out of my furniture.
Now, perhaps you will think something of my
despised legacy. I sold only a few of the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
things that are of so much less use to us than
the space they occupy. There are plenty of
them left, and the dealer is crazy to get them,
too. We need be in no hurry to part with them.
Aunt Nan’s attic is a perfect storehouse of
treasures in that man’s eyes. It was Johnny who
found it out.”</p>

<p>“Me and Caliban,” said John loyally; “don’t
forget him.” And he told the others the whole
story of his following the cat.</p>

<p>“You blessed old Caliban!” cried Mary,
catching up the great bundle of fur and hugging
him tightly. “You shall have an extra saucer
of milk for your supper, so you shall!”</p>

<p>Caliban did not explain to her about the nest
of fat mice which he had discovered in the attic.
That was his share of the “treasure.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>THE PORTRAIT POINTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE winter afternoon some weeks after the
discovery of the coral necklace and the
pearl ring, Mary was in the library alone, reading
“Hamlet.” It was the last play on the list
which Aunt Nan had suggested, and Mary
liked it best of all. Nothing further of a “mysterious”
nature had happened in the library;
but Mary had almost forgotten to think about
anything of the kind. She was reading now for
the pleasure of it.</p>

<p>She had kindled a little fire in the fireplace,
and the library was very cozy, full of flickering
shadows and dancing lights, that played about
the old volumes, and seemed every minute to
change the expression on the bust of Shakespeare
and on Aunt Nan’s picture above it.</p>

<p>But Mary, cuddled up in the big armchair
with Caliban in her lap and the little red book
in her hand, was too much interested in the
fate of poor Ophelia and the unlucky Prince
to notice lights or shadows. She had come to
the scene where Hamlet is talking sorrowfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
to his mother in her chamber, and every word
was wonderful. Suddenly she came upon a
line underscored; the last part doubly underscored:—</p>

<p>“<i>Look here upon this picture</i>, <span class="allsmcap">THEN ON THIS</span>.”</p>

<p>Hamlet was pointing out to his mother the
portraits of two kings, the good one who had
been murdered, and his wicked brother who had
killed him. The underscored line made Mary’s
heart beat faster. She had learned to connect
some pleasant surprise with Aunt Nan’s choice
of quotations. In the margin opposite this line
was penned an exclamation point—just that
and nothing more. Eager as she was to go on
with the story, and to find out what Hamlet had
to say next, Mary knew that it was time to
turn to the notes at the back of the book, to see
if Aunt Nan meant anything in particular by
that exclamation. She could not help feeling
as if Aunt Nan herself had called out, “Stop!
Look! Listen!”—just as the signs at the railway
crossings do to absorbed travelers.</p>

<p>Yes; there was something written in the notes,
in a blank space at the end of a paragraph:
“<i>Look at my portrait! Then turn to the play of
Othello.</i>—”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” said Mary to herself. “I believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
we are coming to another Secret!” And she
felt her heart give a little jump of excitement.
“‘<i>My portrait.</i>’ There is only one portrait of
Aunt Nan.” And she glanced up at the picture
over the fireplace. Then, indeed, she noticed
how the firelight was making Aunt Nan’s queer
eyes dance and glitter, and how her mouth
seemed to be smiling in the most knowing way.
“<i>Look here upon this picture</i>, <span class="allsmcap">THEN ON THIS</span>.”
What did the last part of this line, doubly
underscored, mean to Aunt Nan? Mary studied
the picture long and earnestly. There was something
about it that she did not quite understand.
It was as if Aunt Nan were trying to tell her
something, but could not make the words plain.
Mary felt that she almost had the clue to
something—but not quite. Caliban did not
seem to help her. If John were only here; John
was so good at guessing riddles!</p>

<p>Mary put down Caliban, who promptly
jumped up onto the desk. Then she ran out
into the hall and called, “John! John!” for
she knew that he was in the house, probably, as
usual, ravenous for tea. “Come to the library,
John!” she called again, in answer to his “Hello!
What?”—“I think it’s another Secret. Quick!”
she added, to bring him the sooner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>Down came clattering boots, and John dashed
into the room all excitement. “What’s up?”
he asked eagerly. And Mary showed him the
line. “H’m!” commented John, looking at the
portrait curiously. “She does look sly, doesn’t
she, Mary? But you haven’t looked up the
other thing yet. I say, hurry! Let’s see what
your old ‘Othello’ has to tell about it.”</p>

<p>Sure enough! Mary had forgotten the reference
to “Othello.” Hurriedly she got out the
proper volume, and turned to the right page and
line.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“<i>A fixéd figure for the time of scorn</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>To point his slow unmoving finger at.</i>”</div>
</div></div>

<p>She read slowly. “What in the world does
that mean? I’m sure I don’t know.”</p>

<p>John had been all this time studying the portrait
with its queer expression. When Mary read
the quotation he clapped his hands. “Oh, I
say!” he cried. “It talks about a <i>finger</i>, pointing.
That’s it! She means the hand of the portrait
is pointing to something. It has been pointing
all the time, and we’ve only got to find out
<i>what at</i>! Look, Mary. Don’t you see she is
pointing, just as plainly as can be?”</p>

<p>Mary dropped “Othello” and ran to look at
the picture. The queer eyes of Aunt Nan seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
to meet hers, and yes! she certainly seemed to
be pointing with the long forefinger of her right
hand which rested on her breast.</p>

<p>Mary followed the direction of the pointing
finger, as John was trying to do in the fading
light. It seemed to point to a corner of the wall
on which the portrait itself hung; to a shelf in
the left-hand alcove by the fireplace. Both
Mary and John ran eagerly to the corner and
began to sight from finger to shelf and back
again, to get a straight line from the pointing
finger.</p>

<p>“I think it falls <i>here</i>” said John, touching a
fat brown book labeled “Concordance,” on the
fourth shelf from the bottom. “But I have
looked behind all the books on this shelf. I know
I have!”</p>

<p>“No, it doesn’t fall there,” said Mary. “I
am sure she is pointing about <i>here</i>.” And she
laid her hand on a row of green-and-gold volumes,
whose titles she could hardly read in the
dim light.</p>

<p>“‘Gems from the Poets,’” spelled John with
difficulty. “Do you suppose she means these?
And what does she want us to do, anyway? Let’s
try this one.” He took down Volume I, which
turned out to be “Gems from Marlowe,” a poet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
of whom neither of them had even heard. John
looked under the book, and examined the wall
behind where it had stood, and began to look
through the book itself, as carefully as possible.
But Mary was searching farther. “I don’t think
it is that one,” she said. “I think she is pointing
farther along in the row.”</p>

<p>“Let’s try them all,” suggested John, seizing
another volume,—“‘Gems from Beaumont
and Fletcher’—whoever they are!” He flapped
the leaves and looked in the space at the back
where the cover was loose. But there was nothing
unusual about that book. Meanwhile Mary
was still drawing an imaginary line from the point
of the portrait’s finger to the shelf in the corner.</p>

<p>“I am sure she is pointing <i>here</i>,” she said,
laying her hand on the last volume in the row,
which looked exactly like the others. “‘Gems
from Shakespeare,’” she read the label on the
back. “Yes, of course this ought to be the right
one. She liked him best of all the poets, John.
I believe this is it!”</p>

<p>Mary pulled the volume from the shelf eagerly.
But when she held it in her hands she
uttered a cry of surprise that made John drop
the book he was flapping strenuously, and turn
to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“What is it, Mary?” he asked. “Have you
found something?”</p>

<p>“Oh, John!” she whispered in the greatest
excitement, “it isn’t a book at all! It is—something
else! I think it is the Secret!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>GEMS FROM SHAKESPEARE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was an exciting moment when Mary stood
with the “Gems from Shakespeare” in her
hand, declaring that this was not a book at all,
but something else! What was it, then, which
made her so excited? Caliban eyed her from
the desk benevolently. “Miaou!” he cried.
But no one noticed him.</p>

<p>“What do you think it is, Mary?” cried John.
For he, too, saw in a moment that it was not a
mere book at which his sister was gazing with
wide eyes.</p>

<p>The back, with its green-and-gold leather and
its label, “Gems from Shakespeare,” matched the
rest of the set, so far. And the sides were flat
and cover-like. But the front and top and ends,
where the edges of leaves would naturally show
in any proper book, were enclosed in leather,
so as to make the whole thing into a sort of
case.</p>

<p>“It’s a box!” said Mary solemnly.</p>

<p>John thrust his face up close to the mystery,
and presently he gave a start. In the end where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
you would naturally open the book to read, he
had spied something strange.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary!” he cried; “Look! Here is a little
keyhole! I believe we’ve found the clue to your
key that was in the lantern. Have you got the
key here? Quick, Mary!”</p>

<p>Mary was shaking the box very gently.
“Something rattles!” she said. “What do you
suppose it is?”</p>

<p>“Oh, do be careful. Maybe it is something
breakable. Hurry and find out what it is!”
begged John in the greatest excitement.</p>

<p>Mary always wore the puzzling key about
her neck, on the green silk cord which had come
with it. She now pulled it out, and they carried
the “Gems from Shakespeare” over to the
table, so that they might see better under the
lamp.</p>

<p>Just then there came a knock at the door, and
both children jumped as if they had been caught
in doing something wrong. “Mary! John!”
cried the voice of their mother, “where are you
both? What in the world are you doing? I rang
the bell for tea three times; and I never knew
you both to be so late before!”</p>

<p>“Oh, come in, Mother,” said Mary; “do
come in, quickly!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>The door opened, and there stood Mrs. Corliss
with the Doctor close behind her.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard you shouting at one
another in here,” said Dr. Corliss. “What’s
up? More surprises, eh? Something better than
tea?”</p>

<p>“Caliban looks as if he thought so,” said Mrs.
Corliss. “See how his green eyes glitter!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Father!” said Mary; “it’s the most
exciting surprise of all, we think; because Aunt
Nan has taken pains to make it a part of her
portrait.”</p>

<p>“Part of the portrait! What do you mean,
Mary?” exclaimed her father, advancing into
the room, and like the rest of them forgetting
all about tea in the excitement of the occasion.</p>

<p>Mary showed them the “Gems from Shakespeare”
with the keyhole in the end, and explained
how the picture had guided them to it.
They lighted the lamp hastily, and Dr. Corliss
had to see just how the “slow unmoving finger”
of Aunt Nan’s portrait pointed to the shelf in
the corner where the “Gems” lived.</p>

<p>“Why, yes!” exclaimed the Doctor, examining
the picture still more closely than the children
had done. “And now that I have a clue, I
see something more, that you haven’t discovered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
Look, children! Do you see what this
book is on which Aunt Nan’s left hand is resting?
It is a picture of this very same ‘Gems
from Shakespeare,’ I can even make out a
‘G—S’ on the binding. But I never should have
discovered it without your clue. I believe there
is something in it, Mary!” And he looked as excited
as any of them.</p>

<p>“Well, do let’s find out what is in it!” urged
Mrs. Corliss. “I can’t wait another minute!”</p>

<p>“Neither can I!” cried John. “Hurry, Mary!”</p>

<p>Mary took the little key and tried it in the
keyhole. Yes, it just fitted. She turned it, and
a lock clicked.</p>

<p>“Lift the cover!” cried her father. And Mary
opened what would have been the front cover
of the book, if it had been a book which she
was holding.</p>

<p>Inside the hollow leathern shell which pretended
to be a book was a box; a green wooden
box, with brass trimmings. Mary lifted the
cover of this with a rapidly beating heart. And
what do you think she found?</p>

<p>First of all she found a sheet of paper, at the
top of which was written “<span class="smcap">Gems from Shakespeare</span>.”
Below it followed a list of quotations
from Shakespeare, of a character that made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
them all very much excited; you will readily
guess why. These are the quotations:—</p>

<p>Under this sheet of quotations was spread
a tiny silken blanket of pink. With trembling
fingers Mary lifted this covering.</p>

<p>“Gems from Shakespeare,” indeed! The sight
made them all gasp. There, lying on velvet
cushions, in little pens, were drops and clusters
and strings of pearls; big and little, round and
oval, creamy and lustrous and beautiful. Piece
by piece Mary lifted them out of their beds.
There was a long necklace which would go twice
around her throat; earrings; brooches; bar-pins
and bracelets and rings. Some of the pearls
were set with diamonds, and some with emeralds
and sapphires and rubies; some were made
up into rosebuds with pink coral like that of
the necklace which Mary had found in the bust
of Shakespeare. It was a wonderful collection.</p>

<p>“Well!” cried Dr. Corliss, the first one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
family to get his breath,—“well, Mary! So
you have Aunt Nan’s jewels, after all. She did
not sell them for the benefit of her hospital, as I
believed. She wanted them to go with her beloved
library. There can be no doubt that these
belong to you, and that she wished you to
have them, if you were clever enough to find
them. And a pretty little fortune they will prove,
if I am not mistaken.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i115.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p class="caption">“OH, THEY ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL,” SAID MARY</p>

<p>“Here is a note in the bottom of the box,”
said Mary, drawing out a sheet of folded paper.
Nowadays she did not dread Aunt Nan’s notes
as she had done at first, for she began to think
of the queer great-aunt whom she had never
seen as one of her best and kindest friends.</p>

<p>“<i>To Mary Corliss</i>” the note was addressed,
and it read:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These are my jewels, Mary, since you have
found them—my mere jewel stones. But by
this time, as I hope, you will have learned the
greater beauty of my other jewels—the real
“Gems from Shakespeare.” You will know, if you
have done as I wished, that books are the best
treasure of all. And that in poetry—especially
in Shakespeare’s poetry—are the most precious
gems to be found in this world. These so-called
<i>precious</i> bits of stone and pearl have never been
of any use to me. I have never worn them. Why
I have not sold them long ago, I do not know. Perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
because I wanted to play this one last joke
with them, for somebody’s benefit. They have
been waiting here in this secret place for years.
Now I have played my last joke, and you shall do
with the “Gems” whatever you please. I hope you
will be a wise girl.</p>

<p class="right">N. C.</p>
</div>

<p>“What do you suppose Aunt Nan meant by
that last remark?” asked Mrs. Corliss wonderingly.
“The pearls are far too splendid for our
Mary ever to wear. I should hate to see her
flaunting them, Owen.”</p>

<p>“So should I!” said Dr. Corliss fervently.
“They are grand enough for a princess to wear
at a court ball. What do you say, Mary?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they are very beautiful,” said Mary,
“but I don’t want to wear them, any more than
Aunt Nan did. Father, do you think it would
be right to sell them? I’d like so much to have
the money to help us all—and perhaps there
would be enough so that I could go to college,
too.”</p>

<p>“That’s my daughter!” cried her father,
hugging her proudly in his arms. “That is what
I hoped you would say. I can see no possible
reason why you should keep the jewels. Evidently
Aunt Nan did not care for them herself,
and you have no association with them except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
through her. They can do you no good, except
in one way. So my girl will be able to go to college,
after all, as well as my boy. I am so glad!”</p>

<p>“Thanks to Aunt Nan—and to Shakespeare,”
said Mary, patting the volume of “Hamlet”
lovingly. “If Shakespeare hadn’t given
the clue I might not have found the gems for
ever and ever so long.”</p>

<p>“You might never have found them, Mary!”
cried John. “Ginger! how awful! They might
have stayed here all your life; or some old bookseller
might have got them when you began to
fill up with new books in place of these old ones.”</p>

<p>“Like Aladdin swapping off his old lamp for a
new one,” smiled Dr. Corliss.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mary, “that wouldn’t have happened.
And I should have found them, anyway,
sooner or later. For I shall never part
with one of Aunt Nan’s books. And sooner or
later I mean to dip into every one, and read it
through, if I can. I guess Aunt Nan knew that.”
She glanced gratefully at the portrait over the
mantelpiece, which seemed to look very happy
in the lamplight, while the box of gems stood
open on the table.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>THE PARTY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FROM Aunt Nan’s pearls Mary kept out a
brooch for her mother and two bar-pins
for herself and Katy Summers, just alike. The
rest of the “Gems from Shakespeare” she entrusted
to Mr. Wilde, the family lawyer, who
undertook to sell them for her in the city.</p>

<p>It was an exciting day for Mary when he told
her the result of his mission.</p>

<p>“My dear,” said he, with a twinkle in his
wise old eyes, “those Shakespeare ‘Gems’ of
yours made the eyes of the jewelers pop out of
their heads. You won’t have any trouble in going
to college when the time comes; if you still
wish to do so, and if you haven’t already learned
all there is to be known from that famous library
of yours. I hold forty thousand dollars in trust
for you. Are you disappointed?”</p>

<p>“Forty thousand dollars!” Mary could only
gasp. And the rest of the family had to pinch
themselves to be sure they were not dreaming.
But it was, indeed, a fact. There need be no
more anxiety or overwork for any of them.
With care and economy they were provided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
for until Mary and John should have finished
college and be ready to earn their living. Dr.
Corliss could go on writing his book in peace,
without worrying about bills. Mrs. Corliss could
have a little maid to help her in the housework.</p>

<p>And Mary could have a party!</p>

<p>“Mother,” said Mary, when they had recovered
from the first excitement of the news which
Mr. Wilde had brought them, and when they
had seen that proud and delighted old gentleman
off once more for the city where he lived,—“Mother,
I want to have a party, and give
the other children a good time. I want to celebrate
not only our good luck, but the way we
got it. I want to have a Shakespeare party.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Let’s have a party!” crowed John.
“A dress-up party, Mary?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a dress-up party. Everybody must be
a Shakespeare character.”</p>

<p>“I think that is a very nice idea,” said Mrs.
Corliss. “Next month comes Shakespeare’s
birthday, the twenty-third of April, which is
also Saint George’s day. I think it would be
lovely to have a party and show our Crowfield
friends that Aunt Nan’s house is going to be
hospitable and jolly from this time on.”</p>

<p>They invited all the children in Mary’s class<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
of the High School and in John’s class of the
Grammar School. Everybody was told that he
or she must come in a Shakespeare costume;
and this set them all to looking up quotations
and reading plays more than had ever before
been done in Crowfield.</p>

<p>For days before the party Mary’s library was
crowded every afternoon with eager children
who came to ask questions and get suggestions
about their costumes. Mary and Katy Summers
helped them as best they could, and Mrs. Corliss
pinned and draped and made sketches to
show how things ought to look.</p>

<p>During these busy days Caliban retreated to
the attic and sulked most of the time, because
Mary paid him so little attention. But then,
Mary said his costume was already nearly perfect.
So why bother about him?</p>

<p>They held the party in the library, the biggest
room in the Corliss house. And Aunt Nan’s
portrait looked down on a strange gathering
of folk out of her favorite books. It seemed
as if the old lady must be pleased if she knew
how many persons had become interested in
Shakespeare through the things which had happened
and were still happening in her library.</p>

<p>The door was opened by John dressed as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
Puck, in brown jacket and tights, with little
wings sprouting out of his shoulder-blades.</p>

<p>In the library the guests were received by
Mary in long, glittering, green draperies to represent
Ariel, with a wand and a crown of stars.
She kept Caliban close at her side, beautiful in
a green ribbon collar which bored him greatly.</p>

<p>Katy Summers stood beside Mary, and looked
sweet as Titania, in a fairy dress of white tarlatan,
with a crown of flowers. Dr. Corliss had
been made to represent Prospero, with a long
white beard and gray robes. And Mrs. Corliss
was one of the witches from “Macbeth.” She
wore a dress of smoky gray veiling, with a veil
over her long hair, which concealed her face.
Some of the children were afraid of her at first,
for they did not know who she really was; she
looked very bent and witch-like, and acted her
part weirdly.</p>

<p>Ralph and James Perry, two members of
John’s “Big Four,” came as the two Dromios,
the clowns in “A Comedy of Errors.” Their
faces were whitened, and they acted like real
clowns in a circus, turning somersaults and
making grimaces. Whatever one did the other
imitated him immediately, and it kept the other
children in gales of laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>Billy Barton, the fourth member of the “Big
Four,” made a hit as Nick Bottom, wearing
the Ass’s head, and braying with comical effect;
though as Billy had never heard the strange
noise which a donkey really makes when it
brays, he actually sounded more like a sick
rooster. His long-eared head-piece soon grew
so hot to wear that Billy took it off and hung
it over his arm, which rather spoiled the illusion,
but was much more comfortable.</p>

<p>Then there was Charlie Connors, a very fat
boy, who dressed as Falstaff, with a fierce mustache
and impressive rubber boots, a plumed
hat, belt full of pistols, and a sword. There was
Lady Macbeth, in a white nightgown with her
hair hanging loose, a dangerous dagger in one
hand and a lighted candle in the other. But
when she nearly set fire to the draperies of the
Ghost of Hamlet’s father, Mrs. Corliss made the
Lady extinguish her sleep-walking candle.</p>

<p>Hamlet himself was there, too, in melancholy
long black stockings, with a waterproof cape
flung tragically over one shoulder. He carried
one of Aunt Nan’s ostrich eggs in his hand to
represent a skull. Indeed, the attic and the
“Collections” had helped supply many necessary
parts of this Shakespeare masquerade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>There was Cleopatra, in a wonderful red
sateen robe hauled out of one of the old chests;
and Shylock, with a long beard hanging over a
purple dressing-gown of the Early-Victorian
period. There was Julius Cæsar in a Roman
toga made from some of Aunt Nan’s discarded
window-curtains, and Rosalind looking lovely
in a blue bathing-suit and tam o’ shanter.</p>

<p>There were also a number of little Grammar-School
fairies in mosquito-netting robes, and
many other citizens of places earthly and unearthly,
who seemed to have wandered out of
the books in Mary’s library. Ariel recognized
them all, and named them to the company as
they came in. They squatted about on the chairs
and on the floor till everybody had arrived.</p>

<p>And then they gave the play.</p>

<p>Ever since reading “Midsummer Night’s
Dream” Mary had wanted to try the delicious
foolery of “Pyramus and Thisbe.” It required
no scenery, no other costumes than a shawl or
two, to cover up what the actors were already
wearing to represent other characters. It was
all a huge joke, as the audience soon saw; and
throughout the scene the children laughed and
squealed with delight, as Mary had thought
they would. For the actors must have given the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
play as ridiculously as Shakespeare himself intended;
which was saying a great deal.</p>

<p>Billy Barton, covering himself with a mackintosh,
acted Prologue, and introduced Mary,
draped as Pyramus, and Katy as Thisbe; John,
parted for a time from his wings, and tied up in
a gray shawl, with a fringed rope fastened on
for a tail, was the horribly roaring Lion. Ralph
and Jimmie represented Wall and Moonshine.</p>

<p>It was a very funny thing to see Wall hold up
his fingers to make a chink through which Pyramus
and Thisbe might kiss each other. And when
Lion begged the audience not to be frightened
by his roar, the children shrieked with laughter.</p>

<p>But funniest of all was when Jimmy Perry as
Moonshine came in with the old tin lantern to
represent the Moon, and tried to make Caliban
in his green ribbon act the part of the
Moon Man’s dog. Caliban didn’t like theatricals.
He would not act the part, but lay down
in the middle of the floor, with his feet in the
air, and his ears laid flat, ready to scratch the
Moon Man if he persisted. The Prologue had to
rush in again and drag him off.</p>

<p>When the Lion had roared and made Pyramus
think he had eaten poor Thisbe, so that the
hasty fellow stabbed himself in grief; and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
Thisbe had died, too, after sobbing about her
lover’s “lily lips” and “cherry nose,” the little
play was over, and everybody in a good humor.
And the children said, “I didn’t know Shakespeare
was so funny, did you?”</p>

<p>Then Ariel and Titania, Prospero, and the
Witch made a magic—they were a mighty
quartet, you see. John suggested that they were
really the “Biggest Four.” They waved their
wands and lifted their hands, and Caliban
helped with a mighty “Wow!” Then in came
Puck and the other fairies bearing a huge iron
kettle, with a ladle sticking out of the top. From
the kettle rose a cloud of smoke and a sweet smell
that made Caliban sneeze. The fairies put the
kettle in the middle of the room, and the four
magicians waved their wands over it, and moved
slowly about it singing,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Double, double, toil and trouble,</div>
<div class="verse">Fire, burn, and cauldron, bubble!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>When the spell was finished, the smoke died
away, and the Witch stooped over and ladled
something out, which she threw into the fireplace.
“Now, come, everybody!” she cried in
a cracked voice, “and dip pot-luck out of the
magic kettle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>One by one the guests came and helped themselves
to a ladleful of pot-luck. The “luck”
turned out to be a tissue-paper package tied
with red ribbon. In each package was a little
present. Sometimes the children did not get an
appropriate gift; but then they could “swap.”
Shylock, who was one of the biggest boys, drew
a Japanese doll, which he exchanged for a jack-knife
that had fallen to the lot of a little girl-fairy.
Cleopatra drew a conductor’s whistle,
and Hamlet had a beautiful bow of pink hair-ribbon;
so they made a trade. The Ghost was
made happy with a jews-harp, and the Ass secured
a fan; while fat Falstaff made every one
roar with laughter by unrolling from the great
bundle of tissue paper, which he had carefully
picked out, a tiny thimble.</p>

<p>After this they danced and played games, and
made the roof of Aunt Nan’s old house echo
with such sounds as it had not heard for many
years. Shakespeare characters flitted from room
to room, up the stairs to the attic and down to
the cellar, in a joyous game of hide-and-seek.
And nobody said “Don’t!” or “Careful!” or
“Sh!” This was a night when Dream-People
had their way undisturbed.</p>

<p>Then they all went out into the dining-room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
and had supper—sandwiches and chocolate
and cake and ice-cream. And they all voted that
they liked Shakespeare very much, and that they
ought to celebrate his birthday every year.</p>

<p>Nobody wanted to go home, of course. But in
time, mere ordinary fathers and mothers and big
sisters and big brothers, in ugly, common clothes,
came and dragged away the Shakespeare people,
one by one. When they had all, as Prospero
said, “melted into air, into thin air,” when even
Titania had waved her wand and disappeared
with a kiss on Ariel’s cheek, this happy Spirit
and Prospero and the Witch, Puck and Caliban,
were left alone in front of the library fireplace.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it a lovely party!” cried Puck.</p>

<p>“I am sure Aunt Nan would have been
pleased,” said the Witch, looking up at the portrait
over the mantel.</p>

<p>“Just think what a happy time she has given
us; dear Aunt Nan!” said Ariel.</p>

<p>“Yes; it was a very nice party, indeed,” acknowledged
Prospero, stroking his long beard
gravely. “I confess I never expected to get so
much pleasure out of poetry. But now, to quote
myself, ‘I’ll to my book.’ Good-night.” And
he retired to his study.</p>

<p>“I’m so sleepy!” said John. “Isn’t it too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
bad that poor Shakespeare died before they invented
ice-cream?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mary, “I wish he were still alive.
I should like to see him. But when I look about
the library now I feel as if all the books were
alive—just full of live people!”</p>

<p>“They are alive so long as we read them,”
said Mrs. Corliss.</p>

<p>“I’m going to keep them alive!” cried Mary.</p>

<p>“Miaou!” protested Caliban, scratching wearily
at his ribbon. He at least was tired of wearing
his costume.</p>

<p>“Poor Caliban!” said Mary, untying the ribbon.
“Now you can go to sleep comfortably.
To-morrow I shan’t be Ariel any more. But you
will still be Caliban, for you are the realest of
us all!”</p>

<p>Caliban switched his tail, yawned, and jumped
up into the armchair, where he curled himself
to sleep.</p>

<p>Mary had a strange dream that night. Perhaps
she had eaten too much ice-cream. She
thought that as soon as the house was quiet,
Caliban rose on tiptoe and put on little wings
like those of Puck, and flew right out of the open
window, away to the land of fairies and shadows
and book-folk. She dreamed that though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
she hunted and hunted, she never could find
him again. The dream made her cry, and she
woke up very early in the morning, still sobbing.</p>

<p>The dream was still too real! She jumped out
of bed, flung on her little blue wrapper, thrust
her feet into her blue slippers, and hurried downstairs
into the library. There in the middle of
the mantelpiece, under Aunt Nan’s portrait and
close beside the bust of Shakespeare, sat Caliban.
He blinked in grave surprise at her unexpected
entrance.</p>

<p>“Oh, Caliban, dear Caliban!” cried Mary,
running up to him and hugging him tight. “I
was afraid you had ‘vanished into thin air,’ too.
I couldn’t have borne that, Caliban. I don’t
know what I should ever do without you, pussy
dear!”</p>

<p>“Miaou!” said Caliban, fondly kissing her
cheek.</p>

<p>And Aunt Nan’s portrait smiled down upon
the pair.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
